## Minor Milestones

Minor milestones usually occur at the end of a session of play, or when one piece of a story has been resolved. These kinds of milestones are more about changing your character rather than making him or her more powerful, about adjusting in response to whatever's going on in the story if you need to. Sometimes it won't really make sense to take advantage of a minor milestone, but you always have the opportunity if you should need to.

During a minor milestone, you can choose to do one (and only one) of the following:

- Switch the rank values of any two skills, or replace one Average (+1) skill with one that isn't on your sheet.
- Change any single stunt for another stunt.
- Purchase a new stunt, provided you have the refresh to do so. (Remember, you can't go below 1 refresh.)
- Rename one character aspect that isn't your high concept.

In addition, you can also rename any [[Stress and Consequences#]] [moderate consequences](../conflicts/index.html "Conflicts") you have, so that you can start them on the road to recovery, presuming you have not already done so.

This is a good way to make slight character adjustments, if it seems like something on your character isn't quite right---you don't end up using that stunt as often as you thought, or you resolved the `Blood Feud with Edmund` that you had and thus it's no longer appropriate, or any of those changes that keep your character consistent with the events of play.

In fact, you should almost always be able to justify the change you're making in terms of the game's story. You shouldn't be able to change _Hot Temper_ to _Staunch Pacifist_, for example, unless something happened in the story to inspire a serious change of heart---you met a holy man, or had a traumatic experience that made you want to give up the sword, or whatever. GMs, you're the final arbiter on this, but don't be so much of a stickler that you sacrifice a player's fun for consistency.

> Cynere gets a minor milestone. Lily looks over her character sheet, to see if there's anything she wants to change. One thing that sticks out to her is that during the last session, Zird has been scheming behind her back a lot and putting her in a bad position.
>
> She looks over at Ryan and says, "You know what? I have this aspect, `I've Got Zird's Back`. I think I need to change that in light of current circumstances, and call it, `I Know Zird is Up to Something`."
>
> Ryan says, "Seriously? I mean, it's not like he does it all the time."
>
> Lily grins. "Well, when he stops, I can change it back."
>
> Amanda approves the change, and Lily rewrites one of Cynere's aspects.
>
> Meanwhile, Landon also gets a minor milestone. Lenny looks over his sheet, and notices that he spends a lot more time lying to people than he does trying to make friends with them. He asks Amanda if he can swap the ranks of his [[Deceive]] and his [[Rapport]] skill, giving him Good (+3) [[Deceive]] and Fair (+2) [[Rapport]]. She agrees, and he notes the new skill totals on his character sheet.
