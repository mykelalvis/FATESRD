### What Do Aspects Do?

To write a good aspect, it's fundamentally important that you understand what they do in game. While this may depend on a number of things, aspects on character typically do one or more of five things:

1. [[Grant permission]]
2. [[Make you awesome doing some things]]
3. [[Hinder you in some circumstances]]
4. [[Complicate your life]]
5. [[Create setting]]
