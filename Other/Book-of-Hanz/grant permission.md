### Grant permission

One of the common uses of aspects is to "grant permission" to do certain things that the majority of people can't do. This is probably the vaguest of the four uses of character aspects, so I'll try to clarify with some examples.
Most people can't use magic, but a Wizard Private Eye can.

Most people can't use the Force, but The Last Jedi sure can.

Most people can't go into the palace and talk to the king, but The Brother of the King sure can.

Most people can't find the assassin's guild, and certainly can't get in, but An Assassin in Good Standing can.

As you can see, a lot of times a 'grant permission' aspect follows the formula "Most people can't <blank>, but <aspect> can".

If you've got an aspect in mind, think of whether or not it gives you any kind of permissions. If not, that's fine -not all aspects do.
