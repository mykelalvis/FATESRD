### Make you awesome doing some things

The most common use of an aspect is probably to make you more awesome doing things. When coming up with an aspect, try to think of things that your character might fail at if the aspect weren't true.

"My character might have missed that shot, but `The White Death doesn't miss`."
"I may not have been able to defeat those stormtroopers had it not been for My Wookiie Copilot"

"I may not have been able to jump out of that carbonite trap had I not been The Last Jedi"

"They may have seen me try to sneak by, except for the fact that I'm One With the Shadows"

"I may not have been able to do what I want, but I'm a master of White Russian Diplomacy"
