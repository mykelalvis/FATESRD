### Hinder you in some circumstances

This is the exact opposite of the previous section. Aspects under this category can cause failure when otherwise you may have succeeded.

Now, this is probably an odd concept. Why in the world would you want to do this?

Aspects are triggered by Fate Points. Each scene, the GM gets a Fate Point for each character. If the GM chooses to use one against you on one of your aspects, you get that Fate Point at the end of the scene.

If the GM uses them on one of the NPC's aspects, you don't get them.

Now, rest assured that the GM will use his Fate Point budget on each scene. It's just going to happen. The only question is whether or not you get those Fate Points, one of your fellow PCs gets them, or if they just vanish into thin air.

That said, the template for "bad" aspect use is almost exactly like the "good" ones, so you can think of them in almost the same way.

"I probably would have talked the official into doing things my way, except that I'm obviously not trustworthy since I'm One With the Shadows"

"I would have been able to grab onto that ledge, except my Bionic Hand froze up"

"I would have been able to jump out of the trap, had it not been for my Lame Leg"
