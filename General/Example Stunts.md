# Stunts, listed by skill

## Athletics Stunts

### Balancing and Climbing

- **Acrobat.** You are able to perform impressive acrobatic feats. No individual source of opposition related to balance can be used to justify opposition to your actions. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.5.1)
- **By My Hand, Set the World in Motion.** Through a combination of speed, dexterity, and uncanny timing, you always have a path forward. In a static environment, this means that you are capable of crazy parkour-like movement to get almost anywhere that could be physically accessed. In a more fluid environment you are impossible to pin down or fence in, as you’ll always find the gap. (Fate System Toolkit, p.95)
- **Hardcore Parkour.** +2 to overcome actions with Athletics if you are in a chase across rooftops or a similarly precarious environment. (Fate Core, p.98)
- **Human Spider.** +2 to overcome or create advantage actions with Athletics on any climb. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.5.3)
- **Mountaineer.** +2 to overcome with Athletics when faced with mountainous terrain. (Peter Blake)
- **Pole Balance.** +2 to overcome or defend with Athletics when you need to balance and have a pole in hand. (Peter Blake)
- **Rigging Rat.** +2 to overcome with Athletics when climbing on board a ship. (Peter Blake)

### Dodging

- **Acrobatic Dodge.** +2 to overcome with Athletics when another character presents an obstacle to you moving between zones. (Peter Blake)
- **The Drunkard Stumbles.** (requires Falling Drunkard.) You stagger and stumble without control, but your enemy always seems to miss you and strike a nearby obstacle, causing damage to themselves. When you dodge a blow with Athletics, your opponent takes one stress, or two stress if you succeed with style. (Fate System Toolkit, p.150)
- **Dazing Counter.** When you succeed with style on a defend action against an opponent’s Fight roll, you automatically counter with some sort of nerve punch or stunning blow. You get to attach the _Dazed_ situation aspect to your opponent with a free invoke, instead of just a boost. (Fate Core, p.98)
- **The Drunkard’s Stagger.** You sway and stagger on your feet, evading enemy blows seemingly by chance. When you succeed in a defensive Athletics roll using this technique, you gain +1 on your next attack against the opponent who tried to hit you. If you succeed with style, gain +2. (Fate System Toolkit, p.150)
- **Evasion.** You have an amazing ability to remain unharmed when caught within the blast radius of an explosion. +2 to defend with Athletics against area attacks. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **The Falling Drunkard.** (requires Drunkard’s Stagger.) When an enemy attacks, you lose your balance and fall to the ground, rolling back to your feet quickly, but your enemy now finds himself dangerously overextended. Roll Athletics to dodge. On a success, place a boost on your opponent such as _Overextended_ or _Off-Balance_ that anyone may use against him. On a success with style, place a second boost on your opponent. (Fate System Toolkit, p.150)
- **Favored Enemy Dodge.** Choose an organisation. You gain +2 to defend with Athletics against members of that group. (Peter Blake)
- **Lightning Reflexes.** +2 to defend with Athletics for the first exchange after you become aware of a threat. (Peter Blake)
- **Protector.** You are an expert bodyguard. +2 to defend with Athletics whenever you pull someone out of harm's way at great personal risk to yourself. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Reading the Line of Fire.** You can tell where the bullets will go before the trigger is pulled. +2 to Athletics when using it to dodge gunfire. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Redirect Attack.** Once per scene, when you succeed with style on a defence roll with Athletics against Fight, you may force your opponent to attack another of your enemies in the same zone with the same attack roll. (Peter Blake)
- **Slippery.** +2 when using Athletics to defend against or overcome knockbacks and pushes. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.5.1)
- **War Mount.** You work together with your rider to defend yourselves. +2 to defend with Athletics while being ridden. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### Falling

- **Safe Fall.** (requires Acrobat.) You can skip effortlessly down sheer surfaces. Whenever you fail an Athletics roll and fall vertically near a solid surface, reduce the stress you take by 2. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.5.1)
- **Land On Your Feet.** Like a cat, you are able to fall from great heights without excessive harm. When making an Athletics roll to resist falling damage, add +2 to the roll. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### Jumping

- **Fight By Jumping.** (requires Mighty Leap.) It is normally a very bad idea to jump up high while fighting, but you make it work. +2 to Athletics when creating a jump-based advantage in combat, but all aspects created this way disappear at the end of your next turn. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Long Jump.** +2 to Athletics when jumping significant distances horizontally. (Peter Blake)
- **Mighty Leap/Spring-Heeled.** Your leaping ability borders on the superhuman. +2 to overcome with Athletics whenever height is a major factor. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.5.3)
- **Out of Reach.** (requires Fight By Jumping.) It isn't easy to hit a guy who's five feet above your head. When you create an aspect using Fight By Jumping, you may move into the zone above your current zone as a free action, provided there are no situation aspects restricting that movement. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Vault.** +2 to overcome with Athletics when you have a long pole in hand and the obstacle is primarily height-based. (Peter Blake)

### Sprinting

- **The Bastard Will Not Escape.** Nobody gets away from you. +2 to overcome with Athletics when chasing someone on foot. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Fast as a Leopard.** (requires Sprinter.) You are incredibly fast on your feet. +2 to create advantage or overcome actions with Athletics used to move multiple zones on the flat. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.5.2)
- **Faster than a Leopard.** (requires Fast as a Leopard.) You are simply, astonishingly fast. When you move multiple zones in a straight line, you get an additional +2 to create advantage or overcome actions with Athletics. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.5.2)
- **Run Away!** Discretion is the better part of valour, at least for you. On a successful defence with Athletics, you may sacrifice your next action to immediately flee, making an overcome action with Athletics and using your total on the defence roll as your total on the overcome roll. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Sprinter/Highly Mobile.** You move two zones for free in a conflict without rolling, instead of one, provided there are no situation aspects restricting movement. (Fate Core, p.98)

### Squeezing

- **Contortionist.** If you choose to spend an action moving from one zone to an adjacent one, your Athletics skill works unimpeded by conditions such as narrow openings, low ceilings, or other cramped conditions. (Peter Blake)
- **Escapologist.** +2 to overcome actions with Athletics when escaping from bonds. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.5.1)

### Swimming

- **One With the Water.** +2 to defend or overcome with Athletics while swimming. (Peter Blake)

### New Actions

- **Ball Toss.** Throwing a basketball isn't very different from throwing a knife. You may use your Athletics skill in place of Shoot for thrown weapons. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Equestrian.** You can use Athletics instead of Drive whenever you are riding a horse. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.5.3)
- **Graceful Silence.** Your natural poise and grace enable you to pass quietly and undetected. You may use your Athletics skill in place of Stealth whenever silence alone would help you move undetected. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Marathon Training.** You know how to conserve your energy when undergoing lengthy athletic activity. You may use Athletics instead of Physique during long-distance running, multi-day climbs, and the like. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.5.2)
- **Second-Story Girl.** You can use Athletics in place of Burglary for all overcome actions, provided you don’t have to bypass a lock or interact with other security measures. (Fate Core, p.299)
- **Whirlwind Step.** When you assume the stance of the whirlwind, roll Athletics against Fair (+2) opposition. If you succeed, you may run on vertical surfaces and leap unlikely distances without making rolls to do so, until your next turn ends. If you succeed with style, you may instead gain these benefits for the rest of the scene. (Fate System Toolkit, p.35)

### Other

- **Catch.** When defending against an attack with a thrown object, if you succeed with style, you may catch the item that was thrown at you and create a related aspect with a free invoke, instead of just a boost. Details such as your Physique skill and any relevant aspects may be used to determine whether a given object is something you could, practically speaking, catch. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.29.2)
- **Childhood Playground.** You are remember the place you grew up in well, and you still find it easy to navigate its obstacles. Name and describe that place. You gain +2 to overcome with Athletics whenever you are in a similar environment. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Flanking Specialist.** Once per scene, when you create the aspect _Flanked_ or similar on an opponent, you gain one additional free invocation of the aspect. (Peter Blake)
- **Sportsman.** Sports are your life. Pick a sport. You get a +2 to all Athletics rolls relating to that sport. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Surefooted.** You suffer no increased difficulty to Athletics due to snowdrifts, loose soil, or shifting sand. (Peter Blake)

## Burglary Stunts

### Before the Job

- **The Big Heist.** (requires Mental Blueprint.) Once per scene, when you case a location you can spend a fate point (and a few minutes of observation) to make a special Burglary roll representing your criminal genius. For each shift you make on this roll you discover or create an aspect on the location, though you may only invoke one of them for free. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.6.2)
- **Mental Blueprint.** You’re highly skilled at visualizing the whole of a target based on just a part of it. When casing a location, you receive a +2 on Burglary rolls to create an advantage. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.6.2)

### On The Job

- **Bump and Grab.** Your character is exceptionally skilled at taking advantage of distractions in order to make a quick grab. You may spend a fate point to attempt a simple Burglary action – such as picking a pocket, or palming an object – as a free action. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.26.1)
- **Cool Hand.** A steady hand can be critical when things get hairy. Your hands never shake and never waver. +2 to overcome actions with Burglary whenever you perform fine manual work. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.26.1)
- * **Cutpurse.** Once per scene, as a free action, you can attempt to pick the pocket of someone in the same zone as you. Success at no cost on this roll means your victim is not even aware of the theft. (Peter Blake)
- **Hatpin Maestro.** You don’t ever have to spend a fate point to declare that you have the proper tools for lockpicking or disabling a device, even in extreme situations (like being imprisoned and separated from all your stuff). This source of opposition is just off the table. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.6.2)
- **Preferred Target.** Thieves have specialities, just like scientists. Pick a type of location or object (e.g. banks, apartments, handbags). You gain +2 to your Burglary skill when using it against that type of target. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Security Specialist.** You don’t have to be present to provide active opposition to someone trying to overcome security measures you put in place or worked on. (Normally, a character would roll against passive opposition for that.) (Fate Core, p.99)

### After the Job

- **The Accounting of Small Things.** Once you have successfully stolen something small enough to fit in a pocket, it is gone until you choose to reveal it again. No amount of searching—or even stripping—will reveal the purloined item. You may only have one such item at a time hidden in this fashion. (Fate System Toolkit, p.96)
- **Always a Way Out.** +2 on Burglary rolls made to create an advantage whenever you’re trying to escape from a location. (Fate Core, p.99)
- **Criminal Mind.** +2 on Burglary rolls made to create an advantage when investigating another criminal's work which closely matches a crime you have committed before. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.6.1)
- **Without a Trace.** You don’t have to be present to provide active opposition to someone trying to analyse physical evidence that you were present during a crime. (Normally, a character would roll against passive opposition for that.) (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.27.3)

### Magic

- **Legerdemain.** +2 to Burglary rolls made to perform magic tricks. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.26.2)
- **Master of Illusion.** (requires Stage Magic.) The time it takes for you to prepare a large illusion is reduced by two shifts. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.26.2)
- **Stage Magic.** (requires Legerdemain.) You can perform misdirection on a large scale, under appropriately controlled circumstances. Provided you are acting within an arena you control (such as a stage, or an area you have had adequate time to prepare), there are simply no size limitations (within reason) for your Burglary targets. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.26.2)

### New Actions

- **Disable Device.** If you can take apart a lock, you can take apart a clock. You may use Burglary instead of Crafts to disassemble anything mechanical. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Five-Fingered Discount.** Why buy what you can steal? You may use your Burglary skill instead of your Resources skill to “buy” things. Everything obtained this way has the aspect _Stolen Property_ with one free invocation against you. The difficulty of an attempt to obtain something with Burglary may or may not be the same as the difficulty of an attempt to buy that same thing with Resources, at the GM's discretion. The time required may also vary. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Talk the Talk.** You can use Burglary in place of Contacts whenever you’re dealing specifically with other thieves and burglars. (Fate Core, p.99)
- **Trespass Tempo.** (requires Tripwire Sensibilities.) Whenever you’re running a heist, you operate on a very precise internal clock. You may use Burglary instead of Notice to determine turn order as long as everything is going to plan. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.6.1)
- **Tripwire Sensibilities.** You’ve run into enough traps that you’ve developed an instinct for avoiding them. You may roll Burglary instead of Investigate or Notice in order to spot or defend against a trap. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.6.1)
- **You’re Never Safe.** You can use Burglary to make mental attacks and create advantages against a target, by staging a heist in such a way as to shatter their confidence in their security. (Fate Core, p.89)

### Other

- **Burglar's Signature.** Some element of your character makes you an expert thief. Pick one of your aspects. Once per scene, you may invoke that aspect on a Burglary roll for free. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **I, Lupin!** Somehow, you can always pull of a stroke of larcenous brilliance when it really counts. Once per scene, when you succeed on a Burglary roll, you may choose to succeed with style instead. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

## Contacts Stunts

### Active Networks

- **Center of the Web.** Whether or not you lead it, you are like the spider at the center of a web regarding any organization of which you are a part. Information about the organization flows your way naturally, taking one time increment less to reach your attentive ears than it would normally, and so long as you are able to make any sort of contact with the outside world, you are quickly able to find out information about your organization’s dealings. You also gain +1 to Contacts rolls related to your organization. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.18.3)
- **Discreet Enquiries.** You are unusually subtle when it comes to gathering information. Whenever you seek information and an opponent rolls Contacts to be alerted to this activity, you may roll active opposition against them. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **The Strength of One Becomes the Strength of Many.** Once you begin a contacting effort, it becomes self-sustaining, as people you talk to talk to other people, who talk to others in turn. In effect, you will always get an answer; it is only a matter of time. (Fate System Toolkit, p.99)
- **Ubiquity.** (requires Center of the Web.) First, this stunt steps up the intensity of your Center of the Web stunt – information flows your way a total of two time increments faster. Second, this stunt removes the restriction “so long as you are able to make any sort of contact with the outside world.” Your ties into the organization are so thoroughly widespread that the outside world makes every reasonable effort to stay in contact with you. For a fate point, your organization can even make some fairly unreasonable efforts to stay in contact. (Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.18.3)

### Cold Opens

- **The Bonds of Man Stretch to the Horizon.** There is no place where you do not know someone, including places you have never been before. You will find a friend wherever you go. (Fate System Toolkit, p.99)
- **Bounty Board.** Whenever you enter a settlement, you can look for work. After an hour or so, you find a job that either pays well but is dangerous or is not too dangerous but doesn’t pay that well. If you spend a fate point, it both pays well and is not too dangerous. (Fate System Toolkit, p.41)
- **Criminal Underbelly.** Whenever you enter a settlement for the first time, you can spend a fate point to declare that the local criminals know you. Choose one of the following: they have a lead on a promising job, they’ll give you and your companions free room and board for a few weeks, or they’ll help you with something right now but you might owe them afterward. (Fate System Toolkit, p.42)
- **A Friend in Every Port.** Whenever you enter a settlement, you may declare you’ve visited it before and roll Contacts against Fair (+2) opposition. If you succeed, you have a friend there who owes you one favor—nothing costly or life threatening. If you succeed with style, your friend will do any one thing for you that is within his power. (Fate System Toolkit, p.35)
- **Friends Everywhere.** Your network of contacts extends around the world. You never suffer any increased difficulty on Contacts rolls from being in an unfamiliar area. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### Specific Groups or Subjects

- **Absolute Authority.** You are good at being in charge. +2 to Contacts as long as you are in a position of direct authority over those you intend to contact.
- **Chain of Command.** You are a soldier, and other soldiers answer to you. Add two to your Contacts skill when using it to deal with soldiers from your organisation. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Common Interests/On the Watch.** You know people who know things about the things that you want to know about. Pick a broad subject (e.g. the royal court, baseball, university politics). Add +2 to Contacts when using it to enquire about that subject. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Eye for Talent.** +2 to Contacts when seeking promising young people. (Peter Blake)
- **I'm Looking for Mr. Brown.** You are extremely good at tracking people down. +2 to Contacts whenever you are seeking a specific person whose name you know. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Member.** Pick a specific organisation. You belong to that organisation. Whenever you want to get in touch with its other members, gain +2 to Contacts. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Noble Born.** +2 to Contacts when seeking another member of the aristocracy. (Peter Blake)
- **Renowned Courtesan.** +2 to Contacts when seeking lonely people who would be sexually attracted to you. (Peter Blake)
- **Salesman's Network.** All good salesmen build up a network of satisfied customers over time. Pick a type of product. Add two to your Contacts skill when looking for or dealing with makers, sellers, or notable consumers of that type of product. ([http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Too Cool for School.** All the kids wanna be just like you. +2 to Contacts when dealing with young adults of middle school or high school age. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Walk the Walk.** Your travels have taken you to every corner of the globe. +2 to Contacts rolls when dealing with foreign lands or cultures. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.7.1)

### New Actions

- **Big Man.** Pick a specific field of endeavour, such as crime, business, politics, espionage, or the occult. Within this field, you are considered a person of great importance. You may roll Contacts instead of Resources for anything which might fall under the auspices of members of that field. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.7.2)
- **Big Name.** (requires Big Man.) You’re so well known that an awareness of your name has crossed over into other areas as well. The first time you deal with someone who’s heard of you (spending a fate point can assure that they have), and you’re using your name, you get a +2 bonus to a Provoke or Rapport roll. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.7.2)
- **Big Reputation.** (requires Big Name.) Your reputation has reached great proportions, and people are willing to believe all sorts of things about you. For a fate point, you may use your Contacts skill instead of Deceive, Rapport, Provoke, or Will, provided those you are dealing with are aware of your reputation (a second fate point will nearly always assure that they are). This stunt combines with the bonus from Big Name, getting the character a +2 to Contacts when using it instead of Provoke or Rapport. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.7.2)
- **Ear to the Ground.** Whenever someone initiates a conflict against you in an area where you’ve built a network of contacts, you use Contacts instead of Notice to determine turn order, because you got tipped off in time. (Fate Core, p.101)
- **Insider.** You are able to navigate bureaucracies easily, not because you understand them, but because you know people embedded in the bureaucracy who can provide shortcuts. You may roll Contacts instead of Resources when dealing with any sort of bureaucratic entanglement. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.7.1)
- **My Buddy Has One of Those.** Your friends are very willing to let you borrow whatever you need. You may use your Contacts skill instead of your Resources skill to “buy” things. Everything obtained this way has the aspect _Not Actually Mine_ with one free invocation against you. The difficulty of an attempt to obtain something with Contacts may or may not be the same as the difficulty of an attempt to buy that same thing with Resources, at the GM's discretion. The time required may also vary. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Talk the Talk.** (requires Big Man.) Whenever dealing with members of your chosen field, you may roll Contacts instead of Rapport. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.7.2)
- **The Weight of Reputation.** You can use Contacts instead of Provoke to create advantages based on the fear generated by the sinister reputation you’ve cultivated for yourself and all the shady associates you have. You should have an appropriate aspect to pair with this stunt. (Fate Core, p.101)

### Other

- **I Know a Guy Who Knows a Guy.** Sometimes it’s not who you know, but who the people you know, know. Many of your contacts are, themselves, very well connected. +2 to Contacts when you attempt to corroborate information you’ve gotten from another of your contacts. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.7.1)
- **Rumormonger.** +2 to create an advantage when you plant vicious rumors about someone else. (Fate Core, p.101)

## Crafts Stunts

### Tools

- **Always Making Useful Things.** You don’t ever have to spend a fate point to declare that you have the proper tools for a particular job using Crafts, even in extreme situations (like being imprisoned and separated from all your stuff). This source of opposition is just off the table. (Fate Core, p.103)
- **Big Pocking Wrench.** You can do a lot as long as you have your trusty giant wrench on hand. +2 to Crafts when using it to fix or break something with a large wrench, provided the wrench is actually useful for what you are using it for. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Demolitions.** You are an expert with explosives. +2 to attack rolls made with Crafts against a target structure whenever you have time to prepare and place charges at its exact weak points. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.12.2)
- **The Tools Are Lesser than the Hand.** You can produce master-craftsman-level work with the crudest of tools. With a proper workshop, you can create impossibly amazing devices in the finest da Vinci style. (Fate System Toolkit, p.99)
- **Workshop of Choice.** Pick a specific workshop or machine shop. You know exactly how this place is arranged and how it operates, and gain +2 on Crafts whenever you perform work within it. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))

- **Stonemason.** +2 to create advantage with Crafts when assessing or working with stone. (Peter Blake)

- **Taxidermist.** +2 to Crafts when preserving, stuffing, or posing dead animals. (Peter Blake)

### Techniques

- **Better than New!** Whenever you succeed with style on an overcome action to repair a piece of machinery, you can immediately give it a new situation aspect (with a free invoke) reflecting the improvements you’ve made, instead of just a boost. (Fate Core, p.103)
- **Bricoleur.** You are skilled at improvising when making or repairing something. +2 to Crafts when you creatively incorporate reused materials into your machine. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Eye For Flaws.** +2 to create advantage with Crafts when you examine an object or machine for physical weaknesses. (Peter Blake)
- **Hogtie.** When you use Crafts to create a _Hogtied_ (or similar) advantage on someone, you can always actively oppose any overcome rolls to escape the hogtie (also using Crafts), even if you’re not there. (Normally, if you weren’t there, the escaping character would roll against passive opposition, making it a lot easier to escape.) (Fate Core, p.91)
- **Master Bricoleur.** (requires Skilled Bricoleur.) When you succeed on a roll to which the Bricoleur stunt applies, your success takes two time steps less than normal. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Mister Fix-It.** You are talented at getting things repaired under time-critical circumstances. The time it takes for you to get something fixed is reduced by two shifts. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.12.2)
- **Scavenger.** There is an art to making things quickly out of cannibalized parts. You find it easy, because the people who made the thing you took apart did most of the work. +2 to create advantages with Crafts whenever you disassemble machinery for later re-use. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Skilled Bricoleur.** (requires Bricoleur.) Necessity is the mother of invention. +2 to Crafts when you have nothing to build with except inappropriate materials. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Thump of Restoration/Percussive Maintenance.** (requires Mister Fix-It.) Sometimes a bunch of repairs can get short-handed with a good swift thump. To activate this ability, spend a fate point and roll Crafts (vs. a target of Mediocre). If your roll succeeds, the device or contraption starts working and continues working for a number of exchanges equal to the shifts gained on the Crafts roll. Once the time is up, the device stops working again, and any efforts to repair it are at a one step higher difficulty (since, after all, you hit the thing). If you wish to thump again, you may do so for another fate point, but the difficulty for the Crafts roll increases by one on each subsequent attempt. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.12.2)

### New Actions

- **Locksmith.** If you can take apart a clock, you can take apart a lock. You may roll Crafts instead of Burglary when lockpicking. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Personalized Weaponry Engineering.** Clever engineering can compensate for a lack of combat skill. Pick a broad category of weapon (e.g. swords, polearms, crossbows). When you wield a weapon of this sort that you have created yourself, you may attack with Crafts instead of Fight (for melee weapons) or Shoot (for ranged weapons). Such weapons will often include odd devices and unusual features that make their use very different from that of a normal weapon. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

## Deceive Stunts

### Disguises and Covers

- **Brilliant Disguise.** Once per scene, when you succeed on a Deceive roll to create a disguise, you succeed with style instead. (Peter Blake)
- **Cover.** You have a cover identity you can assume. Describe your cover identity, choose a high concept and a trouble aspect for your cover identity, and choose an apex skill for your cover identity. You can assume that identity with enough preparation and the expenditure of a fate point. While you’re in that identity, its high concept and trouble replace yours and you can use Deceive in place of its apex skill. You lose these benefits as soon as your cover is blown, and you may have to spend some time creating a new cover identity. (Fate System Toolkit, p.42)
- **Double Life.** If you are in disguise at the start of a scene, you gain the aspect _Definitely Not <your real name>_ with one free invocation. If you are not in disguise at the start of a scene, you gain the aspect _Definitely Not <your secret identity>_ with one free invocation. These aspects go away at the end of each scene. (Peter Blake)
- **Infiltrator.** (requires Master of Disguise.) While you are _Disguised as Someone Insignificant_ (see Master of Disguise) you may make a single Investigate roll against a target of Mediocre. Each shift gained can be used to do one of two things: gain a useful (but general) piece of information about the area or group being infiltrated, or leave a clue, hint or message for another character without revealing yourself. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.8.2)
- **Instant Cover.** (requires Fast Talk.) You can whip up a cover story like no one’s business, even if you haven’t made an effort to establish it beforehand. Any time you overcome an obstacle in public using Deceive, automatically add a situation aspect representing your cover story, and stick a free invocation on it. (Fate Core, p.95)
- **Master of Disguise.** (requires Mimicry and Quick Disguise.) You can convincingly pass yourself off as nearly anyone with a little time and preparation. To use this ability, you pay a fate point to disappear from the scene, gaining the _Disguised as Someone Insignificant_ aspect on yourself. At any subsequent point during play, you choose any nameless NPC in a scene and reveal that that character is actually you in disguise! You may remain in this state for as long as you choose, but if anyone is tipped off that you might be nearby, they may spend a fate point and roll Investigate against your Deceive to overcome the aspect. If the investigator wins, he gets to decide which filler character is actually you in disguise (“Wait a minute – you’re the Emerald Emancipator!”). (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.8.2)
- **Mimicry.** You may create advantages with Deceive related to imitating the mannerisms and voice of anyone you’ve had a chance to study. Studying someone usually requires only an investment of time, and not a roll of the dice – at least half an hour of constant exposure. This timeframe can be reduced, but will require an Empathy, Investigate, or Deceive roll against a target of Mediocre - any shifts you get on the roll reduce the time required. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.8.2)
- **One Person, Many Faces.** Whenever you meet someone new, you can spend a fate point to declare that you’ve met that person before, but under a different name and identity. Create a situation aspect to represent your cover story, and you can use Deceive in place of Rapport whenever interacting with that person. (Fate Core, p.104)
- **Perfect Reflection.** +2 to create advantage or defend with Deceive when you are disguised as someone you know well and that disguise is in question. (Peter Blake)
- **Quick Disguise.** (requires Fast Talk.) You’re able to put together a convincing disguise in a heartbeat, using items from your surroundings. You can roll Deceive to create a disguise without any time to prepare, in nearly any situation. (Fate Core, p.95)
- **Trick the Toffs.** +2 to Deceive when you disguise yourself as someone from the upper classes. (Peter Blake)
- **Versatile Disguises.** You suffer no increased difficulty on Deceive rolls when disguising yourself as a person of different gender, height, skin tone, or age. (Peter Blake)

### Feinting and Feigning

- **Dead For Sure.** (requires Play Dead.) While you are _Feigning Death_, no-one will even check to see if you really are dead until all of your allies have conceded or been taken out. (Peter Blake)
- **Fast Feint.** (requires Feint.) Once per scene, you may roll Deceive to perform a feint as a free action. (Peter Blake)
- **Feint.** When it looks like you're going to go right, you go left. And vice versa. +2 to create advantages with Deceive that relate to confusion and misdirection in physical combat. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Feint _En Masse_.** You may feint against every opponent in your zone in one action, dividing your shifts between them. (Peter Blake)
- **Impenetrable Bluff.** You can bluff like a poker pro. Maybe you are a poker pro. +2 to create advantages or defend with Deceive when using it to trick people into believing that you are more capable or better positioned than you actually are. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Not a Threat.** Choose Deceive or Stealth when you take this stunt. When you create an advantage with that skill to make yourself as non-threatening or unobtrusive as possible, enemies will find other targets for as long as that aspect exists. As soon as you successfully attack someone, the aspect goes away. (Fate System Toolkit, p.42)
- **Play Dead.** When you place an aspect like _Feigning Death_ on yourself, no-one can attack you while the aspect remains in play. (Peter Blake)
- **Superior Feint.** (requires Feint.) Whenever you place an aspect on an opponent using the Feint stunt, you may defend against their melee attacks with Deceive until that aspect goes away. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Worthy Cringe.** +2 to create advantage with Deceive when you try to appear unthreatening during a physical combat. (Peter Blake)

### A Fool and His Money

- **Crooked Dealer in Antiquities.** +2 to create advantages with Deceive based on the (false) monetary value of archaeological finds. (Peter Blake)
- **Crooked Salesman.** You are skilled at subtly misrepresenting your goods or services to customers. +2 to Deceive when using it to sell something. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Faustian Pact.** Your job is to trick people into signing unfair contracts. When you have a copy of such a contract to hand, you gain +2 on Deceive rolls to fool people into thinking it is fair. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Grifter/Professional Panhandler.** You profit from your lies, literally. +2 to Deceive when using it to fool someone into giving you money. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))

### Gambling

- **The Devil's Own Luck.** (requires one other stunt relating to gambling.) On games of pure chance, like roulette, where a character could not normally roll a skill to affect the outcome, you may use your Deceive skill at its full value. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.14.1)
- **Double or Nothing.** Once per scene, when involved in a game of chance, you can declare "Double or Nothing!" This is a call for both sides to reroll (and as such doesn’t involve fate points). If you win the next roll, the initial exchange is treated as a scratch (no loss to any participants), but if you lose (by whatever amount) the number of shifts you lose by is doubled. Regardless of the result, such a move often elevates the stakes of a game. This can turn a regular stakes game into a high stakes one, and a high stakes game into a matter of life and death. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.14.1)
- **Know When to Fold 'Em.** Whenever gambling with NPCs, you may ask that the GM roll the NPC’s Deceit in advance. Whenever the GM does this, the roll is automatically considered to be secret – she doesn’t have to show it to anyone. The twist is that the GM must indicate to you whether the NPC’s roll is above or below your Deceive skill – just not by how much. Given this knowledge, you may then choose whether you participates, or excuses yourself, from the gambling contest. If you do participate, the GM reveals the value of the roll, and may still spend fate points on behalf of her NPC as usual once the contest starts in earnest. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.14.2)
- **Winnings.** You win at the gambling tables more than you lose, and are often flush with cash. Once per session, you may use Deceive instead of Resources to represent these winnings, so long as you haven’t recently experienced a loss. You must provide a quick one-sentence explanation of what the resource is and how you won it, when using this stunt. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.14.2)

### Scot-Free

- **Corroboration of Coincidence.** Fate favors your lies with minor coincidences and circumstantial evidence that seem to lend them credence. You may apply a boost to the scene before you roll Deceive, so long as you can describe how it helps you look more honest. If successful, the boost turns into an aspect on the scene. (Fate System Toolkit, p.96)
- **Hey, What’s That?** (requires Fast Talk.) Gain a +2 bonus whenever you’re using Deceive to momentarily distract someone, as long as part of the distraction involves saying something. (Fate Core, p.95)
- **Houdini.** You could be found by the police standing next to a burned-down church with a handful of matches and a can of gasoline and still get away scot-free. +2 to Deceive when using it to defend against attempts to discern or prove your involvement in a crime. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Low Profile.** You always provide active opposition to attempts to locate you with Investigate. (Peter Blake)

### New Actions

- **The Appearance of Wealth.** You seem like a wealthy and powerful person, regardless of the reality. You may use Deceive in place of Resources as long as no actual money or goods need to change hands. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Con Man.** You are a bona fide confidence man, and that lets you get a read on people, easy. You may use Deceive instead of Empathy to read a person’s emotional state and get a general sense of who they are, but the type of aspects that may be assessed or created are limited to things like their trouble or other negatively skewed/easily exploitable aspects. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.8.1)
- **"Honest" Lawyer.** Okay, maybe they don’t exist. But most people would say that you are one, anyway. You may use Deceit instead of Lore whenever knowledge of the law or legal matters are involved. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Illusion of Grandeur.** Making a good first impression is all about misrepresenting yourself. Whenever you meet a new person, you may use Deceit instead of Rapport to influence them. This option vanishes as soon as you fail one of the Deceit rolls. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **It's Just Creative Lying.** Really, acting is just an advanced form of lying. You may use your Deceive skill instead of Rapport when acting. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Mind Games.** You can use Deceive in place of Provoke to make mental attacks, as long as you can make up a clever lie as part of the attack. (Fate Core, p.104)
- **Players' Club.** (requires one other stunt relating to gambling.) You’ve played in so many games, and in so many places, that it’s rare that you can’t find someone who knows you. You may use your Deceit skill instead of Contacts whenever making a Contacts roll – though doing so invariably colors the results with the nature of gambling. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.14.2)
- **Shield of Lies.** Your lies run so deep that you almost believe them yourself. You may use Deceive to defend against mental attacks whenever an opponent focuses on a truth you consistently deny. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Takes One to Know One.** As an accomplished liar, you’re especially able to figure out when someone else is lying as well. You may use Deceive instead of Empathy to defend against Deceive actions. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.8.3)

### Other

- **Bait of Words.** Gain an additional +2 to Deceive whenever you invoke an advantage you personally created by speaking to the target and rolling Rapport. (Peter Blake)
- **Fast Talk.** You get a +2 to overcome obstacles with Deceive, provided you don’t have to talk to the person you’re trying to deceive for more than a few sentences before blowing past them. (Fate Core, p.95)
- **Founded Upon Lies.** You are very good at turning innocuous lies into devastating ones. Once per scene, when you succeed on a Deceit roll, you may succeed with style instead. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **"Good Intentions."** Everyone you meet is certain that you intend nothing but what is best for everyone. Add two to your Deceive skill when using it to create advantages related to feigned benevolence or friendship. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **The Honest Lie.** The best lies are the ones that contain a healthy dose of truth. You gain a +2 to Deceive whenever you incorporate a hefty portion of the truth into a lie. The truth must be relevant, not unimportant, and significant, not trivial – it must be on par with (or bigger than) the lie, or at least in the ballpark. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.8.3)
- **Lies upon Lies.** +2 to create a Deceive advantage against someone who has believed one of your lies already during this session. (Fate Core, p.104)
- **Master Manipulator.** You can treat other people like chess pieces and make it work. +2 to attack and create advantages with Deceive whenever you try to trick your target into following a preset plan of yours. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **One Big Lie.** Pick one specific statement that isn't true. You gain +2 to Deceive when using it to convince someone that that statement is true. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

## Drive Stunts

### On the Road

- **City Driver.** You've spent most of your life driving up and down the same streets. Pick a city. Whenever you are in that city, you never suffer increased difficulty on Drive rolls due to traffic. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Defensive Driving.** You’re good at keeping your car in one piece. +2 to overcome with Drive during a chase. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.9.2)

### In the Sky

- **Barnstormer.** You can squeeze your plane through places where it has no business fitting. You never need to spend a fate point to declare details relating to your plane having enough clearance space to fly or land. What’s more, if you do spend a fate point, you can fit the plane in places you absolutely should not be able to. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.21.1)
- **Death from Above.** (requires Flying Ace.) While in flight, if you are able to make an attack on another flying target from an elevated position, you do two additional points of stress on a successful hit. However, this action takes you out of your position of advantage. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.21.1)
- **Fly By Night.** Whether in dead of night or during a storm, your piloting skills remain true. You never face increased difficulties due to environmental factors (darkness, weather) when flying. This does not protect your plane from taking damage from the environment – but your skill remains unreduced. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.21.1)
- **Walk Away From It.** (requires at least two other Drive stunts.) You have a great instinct for crash-landing planes, and are able to walk away from even the most catastrophic-seeming landings. While you are piloting a plane into its crash landing, coincidence conspires to keep you and your passengers alive, and you pass from the view of the other combatants. You may re-enter play in any subsequent scene in as dramatic a fashion as you see fit, explaining to everyone how you survived. You return with all of your physical stress cleared and a single additional consequence incurred to reflect the dangers you defied. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.21.1)

### On Horseback

- **Bareback Rider.** You suffer no increasing difficulty to Drive rolls while riding an animal due to a lack of saddle, reins, or other tack. (Peter Blake)
- **Breaking It In.** You’re skilled at breaking in new mounts. You receive +2 on all Drive rolls during such an effort. (We suggest you run breaking in a mount as a conflict between rider and steed. The rider should make mental attacks using Drive vs. Will on the animal while the animal is making Athletics or Physique vs. Drive physical attacks on the rider. When one party is finally taken out, takes a consequence, or concedes, either the animal is broken or the rider is thrown.) (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.28.3)
- **Hell Bent for Leather.** You know how to get the best speed out of your mount. +2 to Drive whenever you're on horseback and riding at top speed. You must be an active participant in driving your mount forward in order to receive this bonus. The benefit doesn’t apply if you’re, say, in the saddle, but unconscious. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.28.3)
- **Mounted Trample.** Once per scene, when you succeed with style on a create advantage roll with Drive and place an aspect on an opponent, you may exchange one of your free invocations for a 2-shift hit on that opponent. (Peter Blake)
- **Preferred Mount.** Choose a type of riding animal. +2 to overcome or create advantage with Drive when mounted on that kind of animal. (Peter Blake)
- **Ride Anything.** If it can be ridden like a riding beast, you can ride it. You suffer no increased difficulty for a lack of familiarity, no matter how strange the mount. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.28.3)
- **Run Them Down.** +2 to attack with Drive when you try to trample someone with your horse. (Peter Blake)
- **We Ride as One.** You fight and act on horseback without penalty, and nothing can knock you off. Any time you would take a physical consequence, you can opt for the horse to take it instead — the horse having a similar consequence track to your character. (Fate System Toolkit, p.97)

### On the Water

- **Sailor.** +2 to Drive whenever you use it to operate a water-borne vessel. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### New Actions

- **Flying Ace.** You are a skilled combat pilot, and as such may roll Drive instead of Shoot to attack in a dogfight. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.21.1)
- **Gunner.** You’re a former military man with the training to use vehicle-mounted weaponry. You may use your Drive skill to make attacks with such weapons. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Mechanic.** You may roll Drive instead of Crafts when working on a wheeled vehicle. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.9.1)
- **Mounted Combat.** You may roll Drive instead of Fight to make melee attacks whenever you are riding an animal. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Old Salt.** You may use Drive instead of Lore to make predictions about the weather. (Peter Blake)
- **Plane Mechanic.** You may roll Drive instead of Crafts when working on a vehicle capable of flight. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.21.2)
- **Traffic Watcher.** You really know how to use those rear-view mirrors. You may use Drive instead of Notice to be aware of vehicles and road conditions, to detect vehicular ambushes, and to determine turn order while operating a vehicle. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### Other

- **Flawless Navigation.** The skies (or roads) are an open map in your mind. +2 to Drive when navigating to a strange place or overcoming being _Lost_.
- **Hard to Shake.** +2 to Drive whenever you’re pursuing another vehicle in a chase scene. (Fate Core, p.107)
- **One Hand on the Wheel.** Multitasking behind the wheel is second nature to you. +2 to overcome with Drive after you successfully create an advantage in a contest. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Pedal to the Metal.** You can coax more speed out of your vehicle than seems possible. Whenever you’re engaged in any contest where speed is the primary factor (such as a chase or race of some kind) and you tie with your Drive roll, it’s considered a success. (Fate Core, p.107)
- **Ramming Speed!** When ramming another vehicle, you ignore two shifts of damage. So if you ram and hit for four shifts, you only take two yourself. (Fate Core, p.107)
- **Signature Ride.** You’ve used a certain vehicle so much that its operation is instinctive to you. Pick a specific make and model of vehicle. Add two to your Drive skill when using that sort of vehicle. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Steady Driver.** Once per scene, you may reroll a failed Drive roll for free. (Peter Blake)
- **Turn on a Dime.** (requires Defensive Driving.) Somehow, no matter how crazy you drive, you always seem to pull it off. +2 to Drive when making very tight turns and trying to fit through very narrow spaces. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.9.2)
- **Unsafe at Any Speed.** You are the bane of curbside markets and rickety struts holding up awnings. When you hit an object other than a character or vehicle, increase the stress you cause by 2. Any time an object is taken out by the damage, the result should be spectacular – an explosion or collapse. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.9.2)

## Empathy Stunts

### Insight

- **Architecture of the Heart.** Reading a room is a triviality to you. Even more, you can spot the emotional lynchpins in a room and easily understand how actions would impact the mood. If you roll Empathy to read a room—difficulty Mediocre (+0)—count how many shifts you accrue. Over the course of the scene, you may ask the GM to tell you how people would react to any hypothetical scenario. You can do this a number of times equal to the number of shifts generated. (Fate System Toolkit, p.99)
- **The Artist's Eye.** When you encounter a work of art, you may use Empathy to read the artist's emotional state, as if you had had interpersonal contact with them. You may also create advantages with Empathy related to the authenticity of the work. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.4.1)
- **Cold Read.** Once per scene, you may use Empathy to read a person's emotional state without the need for interpersonal contact. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.10.2)
- **Heart's Secret.** When you successfully use Empathy to read a person's emotional state, if that person's aspects are secret, the aspects the GM reveals must be those that are of the utmost importance to the person, unless you explicitly instruct her otherwise. If the person's aspects are not secret, you may choose which one to attach each of your free invocations to. (adapted from Spirit of the Century, §6.10.2)
- **A Peek Inside.** (requires at least two other Empathy stunts.) You achieve such a strong understanding of your subject that you can start to make some fairly accurate guesses about his behavior. After you have successfully read a person's emotional state, you may immediately ask the GM a hypothetical question about that person’s motives, which the GM must be able to answer with "yes", "no", or "maybe", to the best of her ability. The question must speak to the kind of person the target is, not things they’ve done, though it may ask if they are capable of doing such things. If the GM answers with a "maybe", you may ask a second question to get clarification. This second question may seek details, rather than another one-word answer. (adapted from Spirit of the Century, §6.10.2)
- **Read You Like a Book.** People's emotions are pretty damn obvious to you. +2 to create advantages with Empathy when using it to read a person's emotional state. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **The Truth of Who You Are.** Every two minutes of conversation you have with someone reveals one of their aspects. However, for every two aspects you learn, you reveal one of your own to that person and anyone listening. Round down, so the first one you learn is free. (Fate System Toolkit, p.98)
- **You've Got Issues.** +2 to create advantage with Empathy on a character's trouble aspect. (Peter Blake)

### Lie Detection

- **I’ve Heard Every Lie in the Book.** +2 to overcome or defend against lies with Empathy. (Peter Blake)
- **The Inner Eye Sees Inner Truth.** Without rolling, you can tell if another character is lying so long as the target’s Deceive is equal to or lower than your Empathy. In the case of high Deceive, you will know that you cannot tell, but will never receive a “false positive.” (Fate System Toolkit, p.99)
- **Lie Whisperer.** +2 to all Empathy rolls made to discern or discover lies, whether they’re directed at you or someone else. (Fate Core, p.109)
- **Truth Beyond the Lie.** Once per scene, when you successfully see through a lie, you may gain a free invocation on whichever of the liar’s aspects is most closely associated with their reason for lying to you. (Peter Blake)

### New Actions

- **Animal Empathy.** You can use Empathy in place of Lore to sense the emotions of animals. (Peter Blake)
- **Hit Them Where It Hurts/Disturbingly Insightful.** Your skill at reading people makes you adept at provoking a strong emotional response if you’re trying to get them angry, depressed, or something similar. You may use Empathy in place of Provoke to make mental attacks. (adapted from Spirit of the Century, §6.10.2)
- **Nose for Trouble.** You can use Empathy instead of Notice to determine your turn order in a physical conflict, provided you’ve gotten a chance to observe or speak to those involved for at least a few minutes beforehand during this scene. (Fate Core, p.109)
- **One Breath.** A true samurai can size up a foe within a single breath. You may use Empathy to read when a person will attack you and evaluate their combat skills. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Track the Soul.** Your understanding of people you’ve met is sufficiently strong that it gives you an easy sense of how to find them. You may roll Empathy instead of Investigate whenever you’re tracking down or otherwise trying to find someone you’ve met before. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.10.1)

### Other

- **Bartender's Ear.** Like any good bartender, you know how to understand drunk people. Add two to your Empathy skill when dealing with people who are under the influence of alcohol. ([http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Ebb and Flow.** You are so aware of the social currents in a situation that you are able to see something of what’s coming before it arrives. At the beginning of any exchange, you may spend a fate point to attempt to create an advantage with Empathy. You may then act normally on your turn as usual. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.10.1)
- **Listening Ear.** +2 to overcome or create advantage with Empathy when you listen to another person for half an hour or more. (Peter Blake)
- **Preemptive Grace.** (requires Ebb and Flow.) You are so tuned into social situations that you may act quickly and decisively to shape the situation to your liking. +2 to Empathy for the purposes of determining turn order in a conflict. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.10.1)
- **Psychologist.** Once per session you can reduce someone else’s consequence by one level of severity (severe to moderate, moderate to mild, mild to nothing at all) by succeeding on an Empathy roll with a difficulty of Fair (+2) for a mild consequence, Good (+3) for moderate, or Great (+4) for severe. You need to talk with the person you’re treating for at least half an hour in order for them to receive the benefits of this stunt, and you can’t use it on yourself. (Normally, this roll would only start the recovery process, instead of changing the consequence level.) (Fate Core, p.109)

## Fight Stunts

### Against Multiple Opponents

- **Army of One/The King Still Stands.** (requires Brawler.) You are a one-man army; the odds don’t matter to you. Whenever you are physically attacked by a mob, opponents in that mob do not get a teamwork bonus to their attacks. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.1)
- **Army on the Edge of My Blade.** You take no penalty—and grant no bonus—for being outnumbered, no matter how preposterous the numbers. (Fate System Toolkit, p.97)
- **Brawler.** You’re at home in any big old burly brawl, with multiple opponents and ideally some beer in you. When fighting a mob of nameless NPCs, you deal one additional stress on a successful physical hit. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.1)
- **Follow-Through.** Once per conflict, when you inflict a physical consequence on an opponent with Fight, you may also inflict a 2-point physical hit on another opponent in the same zone. (Peter Blake)
- **Whirlwind Attack.** You may make a Fight attack against every opponent in your zone, dividing your roll between them as you see fit. (Peter Blake)

### Against Specific Opponents

- **Advanced Warmaster.** (requires Warmaster.) When you’re fighting anyone who is armed with a sword, you get a further +2 bonus to creating an advantage using Warmaster. (Fate Core, p.94)
- **Destroyer of Abominations.** You hit harder when your enemy is something blasphemous. You gain +2 to attacks with Fight against creatures that are unusually offensive to your faith. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Favored Enemy.** Choose an organisation or ethnic group. You gain +2 on attacks made with Fight against a member of that group. (Exercise discretion in the use of this stunt. A racist villain is probably OK, but a racist PC is almost certainly not.) (Peter Blake)
- **Favored Enemy Parry.** Choose an organisation. You gain +2 to defend with Fight against members of that group. (Peter Blake)
- **Mirror Stance.** Your unusual fighting style lets you defend effortlessly when you and your opponent are similarly armed. +2 to defend with Fight whenever your opponent attacks you with the same kind of weapon as you wield. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Reflection Shatters the Mirror.** (requires Mirror Stance.) You can switch in a heartbeat from matching your opponent move for move to doing precisely the opposite. +2 to attack with Fight whenever your opponent wields the same kind of weapon as you do. (adapted from [http://dfrpg](http://dfrpg/)-* **Unorthodox Fighting.** People with formal training are less able to defend against your tomfoolery in combat. +2 to attacks with Fight against opponents who strictly adhere to a formal style of combat. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### Counterattacks

- **Riposte.** If you succeed with style on a Fight defense, you can choose to inflict a 2-shift hit rather than take a boost. (Fate Core, p.91)
- **Turnabout.** (requires Riposte.) When you succeed with style on a Fight defense, instead of taking a boost, you may spend a fate point to inflict physical stress equal to the shifts you got on your defense roll. You may only do this once per opponent per scene. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.29.1)

### Defending Others

- **Ally’s Shield.** You can invoke _Dwarven Shield-Maiden_ when a nearby ally suffers an attack. When you do, redirect that attack to yourself. Your defense is Average (+1) against that attack. (Fate System Toolkit, p.34)
- **Defend the Weak.** When someone is attacked physically while within your zone, you can spend a fate point to redirect that attack to yourself. You may defend against that attack at +1. (Fate System Toolkit, p.41)
- **Leave My Friends Alone!** +2 to attack with Fight when your opponent’s most recent action was to attack one of your allies. (Peter Blake)

### Disarming

- **Close at Hand.** You can bring your weapon to hand faster than the eye can track. If the difficulty of overcoming an aspect of _Disarmed_ or similar is Fair (+2) or less, you may overcome it as a free action. If the difficulty is higher, instead gain +2 on the roll to overcome that aspect. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.3)
- **Disarming Specialist.** You have been trained in how to disarm an armed combatant. Once per scene per opponent, when you successfully defend against an attack with a melee weapon, you may sacrifice your next action to place the _Disarmed_ aspect on that opponent. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Firm Grip.** +2 to defend with Fight against being disarmed. (Peter Blake)

### Full Defense

- **Fists of Fury.** (requires Brawler.) Swinging wildly and with force, you can strike at an opponent over and over again, wearing down his defense with each blow. +2 to Fight whenever you punch an opponent who is using full defense. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.1)
- **Flawless Parry/Perfect Parry.** +2 to defend with Fight when you perform a full defense action. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.29.1)
- **Guard Breaker.** When you attack someone who is performing a full defense action, you gain +2 to Fight. (Peter Blake)

### In Specific Environments

- **Blind-Fight.** Your ability to attack with Fight works unimpeded by conditions like darkness or other visual impairments. (Peter Blake)
- **Master of the Roof.** +2 to defend with Fight when you are at a higher elevation than your opponent. (Peter Blake)

resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts)

- **Mountain Warrior.** +2 to defend with Fight when your opponent is at a higher elevation than you. (Peter Blake)
- **Precise Swing.** You suffer no increased difficulty on Fight rolls from aspects related to cover. (Peter Blake)
- **Tunnel Fighter.** Your Fight skill works unimpeded by conditions such as narrow passages, low ceilings, or other spatial limitations. (Peter Blake)

### Mounted Combat

- **Ride-By Attack.** Once per scene, you may move one zone while mounted, attack with Fight, and then move one additional zone, provided there are no situation aspects restricting movement. (Peter Blake)
- **Unhorse.** +2 to create advantage with Fight when you try to remove someone from their mount’s back. (Peter Blake)

### Special Moves

- **Bull Charge.** You know how to use your momentum in a fight. +2 to attack with Fight whenever you move at least one zone unopposed before you attack with a fist or other blunt weapon. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.2)
- **Dispatch the Fallen.** Once per scene, when you attack an enemy who is _Prone_, _Knocked to the Ground_, or similar, you gain +2 to attack with Fight. (Peter Blake)
- **Flying Kick.** (requires Martial Arts.) You are able to leap through the air, leading with a powerful kick that can lay an unsuspecting opponent out. +2 to attack with Fight whenever you move at least one zone unopposed before you attack with a kick. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.2)
- **Killing Stroke.** Once per scene, when you force an opponent to take a consequence, you can spend a fate point to increase the consequence’s severity (so mild becomes moderate, moderate becomes severe). If your opponent was already going to take a severe consequence, he must either take a severe consequence and a second consequence or be taken out. (Fate Core, p.111)
- **Knockback.** When you succeed with style on an attack with Fight, you may choose to reduce the value of your hit by one in order to move your opponent one zone, provided there are no situation aspects impeding this movement. (Peter Blake)
- **Signature Strike.** You have a specific attack which you have honed to devastating perfection. Describe it as an aspect (for instance _Thousand Whirlwinds Strike As One!_ or _Kick in the Crotch_). Once per conflict, as a free action, you can attach this aspect to an opponent as a boost. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.1)
- **Spring Attack.** Once per scene, you may move one zone on foot, attack with Fight, and then move one additional zone, provided there are no situation aspects restricting movement. (Peter Blake)
- **Stunning Fist.** Once per physical conflict, when you succeed on an unarmed attack, you may place the aspect _Stunned_ on your opponent with one free invocation. (Peter Blake)

### With Specific Weapons

- **Do You Like It? I Made It Myself.** A weapon you made yourself is a weapon that you know really well. +2 to defend with Fight when opponents attempt to disarm you or turn the limitations of your weapon against you. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **My Blade Strikes True.** Once per conflict, you can force the opponent to use a mild consequence instead of a 2-point stress box on a successful Fight attack with your heirloom sword. (Fate Core, p.93)
- **Two Sword Joe.** Normally, fighting with two swords just looks cool, but when you wield two swords, you have a decisive advantage. Any time you succeed on an attack with two swords, the stress inflicted is increased by one. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.4)

### With Any Weapon

- **Anything Goes.** Virtually anything can be a lethal weapon in your hands, as long as you can comfortably and casually lift it. You never need to spend a fate point in order to declare that an improvised weapon is close at hand, unless your surroundings have been deliberately prepared against this (such as a prison cell). (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.29.3)
- **Weapons of the World.** Every kind of proper (not improvised) hand-held melee weapon in the world has been in your hands at one point or another. Once per conflict, when you handle an unusual weapon of this type, you may tell a quick two- or three-sentence story (either to another character or as an internal monologue) to gain a +2 on your next roll with it. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.29.3)

### New Actions

- **Bloodlust.** Once per scene, when you inflict a physical consequence, you gain one additional invocation of that consequence. (Peter Blake)
- **Demoralising Stance/My Weapon Speaks For Me/Talking With My Fists.** As a trained fighter, you are able to adopt a stance that makes it unequivocally clear how capable you are of handing someone his ass. Whenever displaying your fighting stance or threatening someone with violence, you may roll Fight instead of Provoke to scare them. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.2)
- **Hidden Weapons.** Your knowledge of weapons helps you conceal them. You may use Fight instead of Burglary to conceal weaponry. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Mixed Martial Artist.** You practice judo or another grappling-based martial art. You may use Fight instead of Physique to create advantages related to wrestling and pinning. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Parry Everything.** Your hand-eye coordination is superb, and perhaps you could even deflect a bullet with your weapon. You may use Fight to defend against Shoot attacks. (The GM may limit this stunt by having it only apply to slower projectiles or those fired from another zone.) (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Whip Grip.** You can use Fight to grab things with a whip. (Peter Blake)

### Other

- **Armiger.** Whenever you take a mild physical consequence, you can choose to instead destroy your armor or your shield, provided you’re using the appropriate item. Once your armor or shield is destroyed, you’ll have to get it repaired or get a new one. (Fate System Toolkit, p.41)
- **Backup Weapon.** Whenever someone’s about to hit you with a _Disarmed_ situation aspect or something similar, spend a fate point to declare you have a backup weapon. Instead of a situation aspect, your opponent gets a boost, representing the momentary distraction you suffer having to switch. (Fate Core, p.111)
- **Dirty Fighter.** (requires Brawler.) You have a talent for fighting dirty and are experienced in pulling all manner of tricks in order to get the upper hand on your opponents. Any time you invoke an opponent’s aspect in a physical fight, you get an additional +1 on the roll. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.1)
- **Competition Fighting.** You excel on the mat or in the ring. +2 to attack with Fight as long as the combat is part of an adjudicated sport and is not a matter of life and death. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Cut Off.** When someone defends against your Fight roll, and they succeed with style, they do not receive a boost. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.3.1)
- **The Drunkard Swings Wide.** (requires Drunken Shove from Physique.) Your blows are crude and telegraphed, but in dodging, your opponent seems to be struck by an elbow or a knee by accident. Make your Fight roll as normal. If you strike your opponent, you do stress as normal. If you miss or tie, your opponent takes one physical stress anyway. (Fate System Toolkit, p.150)
- **Ground and Pound.** When you successfully attack someone with Fight whom you are grappling, you inflict 2 additional stress. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Heavy Hitter.** When you succeed with style on a Fight attack and choose to reduce the result by one to gain a boost, you gain a full situation aspect with a free invocation instead. (Fate Core, p.111)
- **Hold the Line.** When you share a zone with an ally who also has this stunt, you gain +2 to defend with Fight. (Peter Blake)
- **Kick the Bruise.** It really hurts to take two hits to the same place. Once per conflict, when you invoke a physical consequence on a successful Fight attack, you can spend a fate point to increase that consequence's severity (so mild becomes moderate, moderate becomes severe) before your opponent takes stress from your successful attack. If you invoked a severe consequence, your opponent must either take a consequence from your attack or be taken out. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Martial Arts.** You have an acute insight into the means and methods of barehanded warfare. +2 to create advantages with Fight when you assess another martial artist's style. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.2)
- **Brickbreaker/Board Breaking.** (requires Martial Arts.) You are able to focus the force of your blows into a concentrated, small area that is devastating to solid materials. You may make attacks with your body against objects that would typically only be damaged by weapons or tools. If you attack something softer, such as wood, any stress you deal is doubled. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.2)
- **Fist of Death.** (requires Martial Arts.) By concentrating your force into a powerful blow, you may devastate even the most potent of opponents. Once per opponent per fight, you may spend a fate point after landing a successful blow to cause your opponent to check their highest unchecked physical stress box (instead of taking stress equal to the shifts you succeeded by). (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.13.2)
- **Martial Scholar.** (requires Martial Arts.) Once you know your opponent, besting them is easy. When you successfully create an advantage with Fight based on assessing an opponent's combat style, you gain an extra free invocation. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Right Back At You.** (requires Parry Everything.) Once per scene, when you succeed with style on a Fight defence against a Shoot attack, you may send the projectile flying back towards your attacker, inflicting a 2-shift physical hit on them. (Peter Blake)
- **Spears of Green Wood.** You may train a body of troops—unnamed characters in a group of up to approximately 100—for a week and increase their Fight Skill by +1. You can repeat this multiple times, improving any given unit to a maximum of your Fight -2. (Fate System Toolkit, p.97)
- **Steady the Drunkard.** (requires The Drunkard Swings Wide.) You stagger and seem about to fall, so you reach out and grab your opponent’s arm to steady yourself. This seemingly unintentional grip blocks chi and paralyzes your opponent. You may place a _Chi Blocked_ situation aspect with a free invocation on your opponent. Your opponent may not use any kung fu stunts until they remove this aspect. (Fate System Toolkit, p.150)
- **Use Their Strength Against Them.** Excessive strength can be a disadvantage if your opponent knows how to exploit it. +2 to Fight rolls made to defend against an opponent, provided the opponent is physically much stronger than you. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Warmaster.** +2 to Fight rolls made to create an advantage against an opponent, provided the opponent has a fighting style or weakness you can exploit. (Fate Core, p.299)
- **Weapon Finesse.** +2 to create advantages with Fight related to fancy but harmless bladework, such as cutting your insignia into your opponent’s clothing. (Peter Blake)

## Investigate Stunts

### Senses

- **Eavesdropper.** On a successful Investigate roll to create an advantage by eavesdropping on a conversation, you can discover or create one additional aspect (though this doesn’t give you an extra free invocation). (Fate Core, p.113)
- **Eye for Detail.** (requires Scene of the Crime.) Your visual memory is so strong that with a little concentration, you can revisit any place you've been to in your memory in exacting detail. Sometimes, you can even pick up on details that you hadn’t consciously realized before. To use this ability, spend a fate point and make a single perception-based roll (usually Investigate, but not necessarily limited to that) to find things out as if you were still in the location, no matter how long ago you left it. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.17.1)
- **Focused Senses.** You are skilled at concentrating on one of your senses to the exclusion of all others. The sense must be specified at the time this stunt is taken. As a free action, you may gain the _Focused on My Senses_ aspect. So long as this aspect remains, for as long as you use nothing but Investigate, all Investigate actions you take that use the specified sense gain a +2 bonus. However, your opponents may invoke the aspect against you once for free. Rolling a skill other than Investigate removes the aspect. (This stunt may be taken multiple times, each time for a single sense. If you have specified multiple senses, your focus may cover all of them at once.) (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.17.2)
- **Impossible Detail.** (requires Focused Senses.) When paying attention, your senses operate at a profound level of focus, allowing you to pick up on details that, very simply, no one else easily or even possibly could. With this stunt, you face no increased difficulties due to a physical detail being too small or subtle. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.17.2)
- **Scene of the Crime.** You have a strong visual memory, and whenever you revisit a place where you have used Investigate before, it takes a matter of seconds for you to use Investigate to determine what has changed since you were last there. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.17.1)

### Specific Targets

- **De-Bugger.** +2 to overcome with Investigate when you sweep a room for surveillance devices. (Peter Blake)
- **Game Hunter’s Nose.** Choose a type of animal. You gain +2 to create advantage or overcome with Investigate when you search for or track that kind of animal. (Peter Blake)
- **Hit the Books.** +2 to overcome or create advantage with Investigate when you seek or consult textual sources. (Peter Blake)
- **Internal Affairs.** +2 to overcome or create advantage with Investigate when on the trail of corruption. (Peter Blake)
- **Plague Hunter.** +2 to Investigate when you seek people with a highly infectious disease. (Peter Blake)
- **Relic Hunter.** +2 to Investigate when you seek artefacts from ancient civilizations. (Peter Blake)
- **Tracker.** +2 to Investigate rolls made to analyse or follow a person or creature's physical trail. (Peter Blake)

### Deduction

- **The Pieces of the Puzzle.** When you take a few minutes to study a particular item and its position, you can reasonably reconstruct the chain of events that led to it being there. This reconstruction will be accurate, though it will not reveal any more than the necessary details. For example, it might reveal that it was carried by hand at some point, but not by whom. (Fate System Toolkit, p.93)
- **The Power of Deduction.** Once per scene you can spend a fate point (and a few minutes of observation) to make a special Investigate roll representing your potent deductive faculties. For each shift you make on this roll you discover or create an aspect, on either the scene or the target of your observations, though you may only invoke one of them for free. (Fate Core, p.113)
- **Uncanny Hunch.** (requires one other Investigate stunt and one Empathy stunt.) Sometimes your guesses play out to great advantage. Once per scene, you may make a guess about what the “deal” is with a particular character, object, location, or situation. Do not speak this guess aloud; write it down on a piece of paper and give it to the GM. The GM must accept it as a valid hunch that would be something of a revelation if true (i.e., no “I’m convinced that moon orbits the Earth!” – that’s too obvious). If, at some later point, your hunch proves to be correct, you may use your Investigate or Empathy skill instead of any other skill, where that target is concerned, for one exchange. (A savvy GM will occasionally alter her characters’ motives to match your hunches; if she does, that’s absolutely perfect!) (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.17.1)

### New Actions

- **Attention to Detail.** You can use Investigate instead of Empathy to defend against Deceive attempts. What others discover through gut reactions and intuition, you learn through careful observation of microexpressions. (Fate Core, p.113)
- **Going Undercover.** Sometimes looking like someone else is just part of a detective's job. You may use Investigate in place of Deceive to create and maintain disguises or cover identities. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **I Will Find Out What I Want To Know.** There's not much point being able to get information from a crime scene if you can't get information from a person. You may use Investigate in place of Provoke to interrogate a suspect.
- **Investigative Reporter.** Your writing style depends more upon good research than anything else. You may use Investigate instead of Provoke or Rapport for journalism. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Lip Reader.** You may use Investigate to eavesdrop on conversations you can only see. If the GM would normally allow someone to attempt to read lips, you gain +2 to the roll; otherwise, you may simply roll Investigate when others may not. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.17.2)
- **Look Behind You.** Following a suspect is easy; doing it without their knowledge is the trick, and you've got that trick down. You may use Investigate in place of Stealth when shadowing a "person of interest". (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Reading Suspects.** Part of being a good detective is knowing "whodunit" long before anything can be proved. You may use Investigate in place of Empathy when you have at least one piece of evidence indicating that your target is a suspect in your current case. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **They Don't Deserve the Truth.** You may use Investigate in place of Deceive to lie to about a case. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### Other

- **Quick Eye.** You are able to investigate a location much more quickly than others, while still being very thorough. All Investigate efforts you make happen one to two time increments faster than usual, allowing you to make one or two additional rolls in the same amount of time, or simply conclude your investigation faster than you would otherwise. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.17.2)

## Lore Stunts

### Beasts

- **Animal Affinity.** Pick a particular type of animal (cats, rodents, horses or the like). At the start of any scene, if that type of animal could reasonably appear in the location where the scene is set, you may make a Lore check against a difficulty of Fair (+2). If you succeed, there is an animal of this type in the scene. (Peter Blake)
- **Animal Friend.** Pick a particular type of animal (cats, rodents, horses or the like). You can communicate with animals of this type using a combination of speech and gestures. This doesn’t connote a special level of intelligence on the part of the animals, so the communication may be relatively simple. You also gain +2 to your rolls when interacting socially with animals of this type. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.28.1)
- **Kindred Beast.** (requires Wild Empathy.) Choose a type of animal. You gain a further +2 to create advantage or overcome when you try to calm or communicate with animals of that kind. (Peter Blake)
- **King of the Beasts.** (requires Animal Friend.) This stunt functions as Animal Friend does, but the character may speak to an entire broad category of animals, rather than just one type. For purposes of this ability there are three main categories – creatures from or from near the sea (fish, whales, seabirds), creatures from the land (dogs, primates, cats, birds) and vermin (bugs, rats and other small scuttling things). There is loose overlap between these categories – pigeons are in all three – and the GM is encouraged to be generous in her interpretation. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.28.1)
- **Wild Empathy.** +2 to create advantage or overcome with Lore when you try to calm or communicate with animals. (Peter Blake)

### Languages

- **The Blessing of a Thousand Tongues.** You may learn any language quickly. With tutelage, it takes only a day. With only the opportunity to read or listen, it takes a week. If the source material is especially sparse, it may take as long as a month. (Fate System Toolkit, p.94)
- **Gift of Tongues.** (requires Linguist). There is no “mainstream” earthly language you cannot read or speak. Not only that, but you read and speak languages you have no business having learned, such as languages from lost cultures. You may spend a fate point to declare that you know any particular language, no matter how strange. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.2.1)
- **Linguist.** You know a wide range of languages. +2 to Lore whenever reading, writing, speaking or translating an unusual language. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.2.1)
- **Shared Humanity.** Once per scene, you can communicate a short message to another human even if you do not speak a common language. (Peter Blake)

### Memory

- **Photographic Memory.** (requires Walking Library.) +2 to Lore rolls whenever you lack direct access to research materials and the answer you seek lies in something you have read before. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.2.2)
- **Studied Recall.** (requires Photographic Memory.) Your photographic memory extends outside of books. Once per scene, you may spend a fate point and roll Lore against a difficulty of Mediocre. Each shift you generate may be used to specify a target that you wish to memorize as you might a book – returning later, in your mind, to assess new details (using an appropriate perception skill, usually Investigate). (This ability differs from Investigate’s Eye for Detail stunt in that Eye for Detail covers the entire location, after the fact, whereas Studied Recall requires you to specify which individual pieces of a location you are studying, while you are still in that location.) (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.2.2)
- **Walking Library.** Your prodigious reading has paid off in spades, and you are able to recall minute details from even the most obscure literary works. You don’t ever have to spend a fate point to declare that you have the proper tools for research using Lore, even in extreme situations (like being imprisoned and unable to access a library). This source of opposition is just off the table. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.2.2)

### Medicine

- **Drinking from the Jug.** You pause to take a swig of wine from your jug, fortifying yourself for the battle. When you have a drink during a fight, clear your lowest stress box. This requires you to take an entire action drinking. (Fate System Toolkit, p.150)
- **Forensic Medicine.** You can use Lore in place of Investigate when the subject involves medical evidence. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.25.1)
- **Heal Thyself.** (requires Scholar, Healer.) +2 to treat your own physical consequences with Lore. (Peter Blake)
- **Herbal Remedies.** +2 to Lore rolls related to gathering plants suitable for treating the sick or injured. (Peter Blake)
- **Plastic Surgeon.** (requires Scholar, Healer.) You know how to rearrange someone's face permanently. When you operate on a patient, you may use Lore to inflict physical stress on them. The greater the change you wish to make, the graver the consequence you must successfully inflict. (The GM decides what level of consequence is required for each change, and the consequence acts as justification for the patient to change an aspect to one relating to physical appearance at the next milestone. To alter an aspect against a character's will requires you to inflict an extreme consequence.) (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Pouring Wine.** (requires Drinking from the Jug.) You take out a cup and pour a drink from your jug. This elaborate and difficult task causes a pause in the battle. No one may attack you while you pour, and you remove your lowest stress mark. This technique requires an entire action, and you may not perform the technique more than once in a row. (Fate System Toolkit, p.150)
- **Scholar, Healer.** Can make physical recovery attempts with Lore. (Fate Core, p.300)
- **Surgeon/Medical Specialist.** (requires Scholar, Healer.) You are a respected authority in a specific field of surgical or therapeutic medicine; define it at the time you take this stunt. Possibilities include heart or brain surgery, transplant operations, disease pathologies, and so on. You get a +2 to all Lore rolls relating to that field. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.25.1)

### Scholarship

- **Dizzying Intellect.** (requires Specialist.) Your area of knowledge is so advanced, there’s usually no one around who can tell if you’re making things up. You may use Lore in place of Deceive to tell lies related to your field of specialization. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.2.3)
- **It's Academic.** (requires Specialist.) Once per scene you can spend a fate point (and a few minutes of observation) to make a special Lore roll representing a flash of insight. For each shift you make on this roll you discover or create an aspect related to your field of specialization, on either the scene or the target of your observations, though you may only invoke one of them for free. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.2.3)
- **Secrets of the Stacks.** Pick a specific library or other large information resource. You are intimately familiar with this resource's quirks, and gain a +2 to Lore whenever you have sufficient time to consult it. (Peter Blake)
- **Specialist.** Choose a field of specialization, such as herbology, criminology, or zoology. You get a +2 to all Lore rolls relating to that field of specialization. (Fate Core, p.115)
- **Tutor.** +2 to create advantage on an ally with Lore when you spend an hour or so coaching them on an appropriate topic. (Peter Blake)

### Survival

- **Caveman Lifestyle.** You know how to live naked in the wilderness. When you undertake survival activities, you never suffer increased difficulty due to a lack of tools. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Due North.** You always know which direction north is, flawlessly, even underground, without a compass or stars to guide you. You gain a +2 to Lore rolls whenever trying to find your way out of a place. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.28.2)
- **Forager.** Choose a natural habitat (e.g. forests, grasslands, deserts, oceans, or caves). You gain +2 to Lore when gathering food in that habitat. (Peter Blake)
- **Natural Dowser.** +2 to create advantage with Lore when you seek sources of water. (Peter Blake)
- **Pathfinder.** Navigating on foot with your Lore skill works impeded by poor visibility or difficult terrain. (Peter Blake)
- **Scout the Path.** +2 to create advantage with Lore when blazing a trail through the wilderness. (Peter Blake)
- **Self-Sufficient.** You don’t ever have to spend a fate point to declare that you are able to find enough food and water for yourself, even in extreme situations (like being dumped in the middle of the desert and separated from all your stuff). This source of opposition is just off the table. (Peter Blake)

### New Actions

- **Advanced Ritualist.** (requires Ritualist.) You gain a +2 bonus when you use Lore in place of another skill during a challenge. This allows you to use Lore twice in the same challenge. (Fate Core, p.94)
- **Actions Speak Louder Than Words.** Dealing with animals, who don't talk, has given you an excellent grasp of body language. You may use your Lore skill instead of Empathy to defend against attempts to attack or create advantage with Deceive. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Animal Magnetism.** It's a bit demeaning to equate seduction to animal training, but in your experience there isn't all that much difference between the two activities. You may use Lore instead of Provoke to seduce people. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Cracker.** You may use Lore in place of Burglary to defeat computerised security. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Formal Logic/Master of Riddles.** Your intelligence lets you run circles around those you talk to. This may take the form of actual riddles, or perhaps just complex logical arguments. You may use Lore to make attacks that inflict mental stress and to create advantages related to confusing and overaweing people. Such actions can be defended against with Rapport, Lore, or Empathy. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Frontiersmen Have To Improvise.** Making stuff out of the things around you is an integral part of wilderness survival. You may use Lore in place of Crafts to build things out of scavenged materials. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Outdoorsman.** Your extensive field experience helps you operate in the wild. You may roll Lore instead of Stealth whenever you are in the wilderness, and may also roll Lore instead of Investigate for tracking in those areas. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Pre-Prepared Counterpoint.** You’ve heard that argument before, and you know how to defeat it. You may use Lore to defend against Rapport. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Professional Teacher.** You may use Lore in place of Rapport to interact with your students. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Ritualist.** Use Lore in place of another skill during a challenge, allowing you to use Lore twice in the same challenge. (Fate Core, p.91)
- **Shield of Reason.** You can use Lore as a defense against Provoke attempts, provided you can justify your ability to overcome your fear through rational thought and reason. (Fate Core, p.115)
- **Theory in Practice.** (requires Specialist.) Once per scene you can spend a fate point to use Lore in place of any other skill for one roll. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.25.2)
- **They're In the Trees.** Basic wilderness survival includes a great deal of stealth. You may use Lore in place of Stealth as long as you are outdoors. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Well-Travelled.** You may use Lore instead of Rapport when you have visited the homeland or home state of the person you are speaking to. (Peter Blake)

### Other

- **Arcane Expert.** Gain a +2 bonus to create an advantage using Lore, whenever the situation has specifically to do with the supernatural or occult. (Fate Core, p.90)
- **Bletchley's Finest.** +2 to overcome with Lore when cracking a code. (Peter Blake)
- **Dealer in Antiquities.** +2 to create advantages with Lore based on the monetary value of archaeological finds. (Peter Blake)
- **Experimenter.** While others are content to read the journals, you have the training and drive to perform cutting-edge research. +2 to Lore whenever you run original scientific experiments or gather original research data. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **The Eye Sees All Paths.** You may not know everything, but you always know how to find out. When looking for a fairly specific piece of information, you may give the GM a fate point to be told the closest place you can go to find out, no matter how obscure or lost the information is. In short, you can never hit a wall when trying to find something out. There are no guarantees of how easy it will be to get the knowledge, but that’s what adventure is for. (Fate System Toolkit, p.93)
- **I’ve Read about That!** You’ve read hundreds—if not thousands—of books on a wide variety of topics. You can spend a fate point to use Lore in place of any other skill for one roll or exchange, provided you can justify having read about the action you’re attempting. (Fate Core, p.115)
- **Keeper of Folklore.** +2 to Lore when recalling the history or legends of your people. (Peter Blake)
- **Legal Eagle.** +2 to overcome or create an advantage with Lore, whenever you are finding or exploiting loopholes in the law. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.18.2)
- **Meteorologist.** You are trained as a meteorologist and so you are skilled at weather prediction. +2 to Lore when creating advantages to do with the weather. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **World Court.** (requires Legal Eagle.) Your exposure to international law is so extensive that you’re at ease in any situation involving legal wrangling, wherever you are. You never suffer any increased difficulty from a lack of familiarity with the laws of your locale; your experience is so broad that you’ve either know it already, or can make highly educated guesses about how it functions. (Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.18.2)

## Notice Stunts

### Reflexes

- **On Top Of It.** You may spend a fate point to go first in an exchange, regardless of your Notice. If multiple people with this stunt exercise this ability, they go in turn based on their skills, before those who don’t exercise the stunt get a chance to act. If the exchange has already started, and you have not yet acted, you may instead spend a fate point to act next, out of the usual turn order. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.3.1)
- **Ready for Anything.** (requires On Top Of It.) Your senses are so keyed into minute changes that you are able to respond more quickly to new details. Your Notice is considered to be one higher for purposes of determining turn order. This stunt breaks ties whenever facing opponents with the same Notice. This stunt may be taken multiple times, each time increasing the character’s effective Notice by 1. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.3.1)
- **Run Interference.** (requires Ready for Anything.) Whenever it is determined that you provide active opposition to another character's action, you may spend a fate point. When you do, the other character may choose to attempt another action instead. If they do not, you receive +2 on your defend roll against the original action. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.3.1)

### Vigilance

- **Constant Vigilance.** (requires Saw It Coming.) When you are ambushed, gain a further +2 to the first defend roll you make. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.3.2)
- **Danger Sense.** You have an almost preternatural capacity for detecting danger. Your Notice skill works unimpeded by conditions like total concealment, darkness, or other sensory impairments in situations where someone or something intends to harm you. (Fate Core, p.117)
- **Saw It Coming.** (requires Danger Sense.) When you are ambushed, gain +2 to any defend rolls you make in the first exchange. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.3.2)
- **The Eye Gazes in All Directions.** You are never surprised. Even if it’s only by a moment, you are always forewarned of the unexpected. (Fate System Toolkit, p.93)
- **Sentry.** You have the ability to wait, devoting your full effort to watchfulness, for hours on end. +2 to defend with Notice whenever you are tired. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Take It All In.** Once per scene you can spend a fate point (and a few minutes of observation) to make a special Notice roll representing opening your senses to a location. For each shift you make on this roll you discover or create an aspect related to direct observation on the scene, though you may only invoke one of them for free. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.3.2)

### New Actions

- **Body Language Reader.** You can use Notice in place of Empathy to learn the aspects of a target through observation. (Fate Core, p.117)
- **Master of the Tell.** (requires Notice Tell.) Long practice has made you incomparably good at noticing the mannerisms that accompany deception. +2 to Notice when using it to defend against Deceive. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Notice Tell.** Your keen senses allow you to pick up on the subtle clues that indicate when a person is lying. You may use Notice to defend against Deceive. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Reactive Shot.** You can use Notice instead of Shoot to make quick, reactive shots that don’t involve a lot of aiming. However, because you’re having a knee-jerk reaction, you’re not allowed to concretely identify your target before using this stunt. So, for example, you might be able to shoot at someone you see moving in the bushes with this stunt, but you won’t be able to tell if it’s friend or foe before you pull the trigger. Choose carefully! (Fate Core, p.117)

### Other

- **The Advantage of Familiarity.** There are benefits to knowing a place really well. Pick a location or a small neighbourhood. +2 to Notice while you are in that area. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Attention!** You have been trained to follow orders instantly in combat. When determining turn order for a physical conflict, you may use an ally's Notice skill instead of your own. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Game Hunter’s Eye.** Choose a type of animal. You gain +2 to create advantage or overcome with Notice to spot that kind of animal. (Peter Blake)
- **Heightened Awareness.** +2 to defend with Notice during a physical conflict. (Peter Blake)
- **Hidey-Holes.** +2 to create advantage with Notice based on finding a suitable location to stay hidden. (Peter Blake)
- **Keen Sense.** Choose a physical sense (e.g. sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell). You gain +2 to defend or overcome with Notice when that sense is the primary one being used. (Peter Blake)
- **Recognise Imposter.** +2 to overcome with Notice when faced someone claiming to be a celebrity or someone you know well. (Peter Blake)

## Physique Stunts

### Endurance

- **Always Healthy/Strong Immune System.** +2 to overcome rolls with Physique to resist disease. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Death Defiance.** If you are taken out in a physical conflict, you may spend a fate point to concede instead. After you have collected fate points for conceding, you must spend a further amount of half of your fate points, rounded down. Coincidence conspires to keep you alive, and you pass from the view of the other combatants (such as by dropping off a cliff, apparently failing to escape from an exploding building, or the like). You may re-enter play in any subsequent scene in as dramatic a fashion as you see fit, explaining to everyone how you survived. You return with all of your physical stress cleared and a single additional consequence incurred to reflect the dangers you defied. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.2)
- **Desertborn.** +2 to overcome or defend with Physique against heat and thirst. (Peter Blake)
- **Developed Immunities.** (requires Toxin Exposure.) You gain a further +2 to overcome rolls with Physique to resist any poison you have previously encountered "on screen". (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.2)
- **Large Lung Capacity.** +2 to Physique to overcome or defend against suffocation or drowning. (Peter Blake)
- **Last Leg.** You may spend fate points to keep standing. Any time you would suffer a consequence or be taken out by physical stress, you may spend a fate point to remain standing or otherwise defer a consequence for one more exchange, or until you take stress again, whichever comes first. Once the extra time you've bought is up, all the effects you have deferred come to bear at once. You may keep spending fate points each time the time limit expires until you run out. (This makes it possible for you to be taken out by a character who has already conceded or been taken out in the intervening time!) (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.1)
- **Tireless.** +2 to Physique when rolling to overcome or defend against exhaustion or sleep deprivation. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.1)
- **Toxin Exposure.** +2 to overcome rolls with Physique to resist poisons. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.2)

### Pushing and Shoving

- **Body Toss.** (requires Wrestler.) You know how to apply your strength in a fight to take people off their feet. +2 to create advantages with Physique whenever you try to throw or push someone. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.19.2)
- **Domino Effect.** When you succeed with style on an attempt to push over or trip an opponent, you may create an additional identical aspect on another weaker opponent in the same zone. Both aspects come with one free invocation. (“Weaker opponent” here means an opponent with a lower Physique than the one who defended against your action.) (Peter Blake)
- **The Drunken Shove.** Your rude and artless push contains a greater power than seems possible. You gain +2 to use Physique to create an advantage on an opponent by knocking them off balance. (Fate System Toolkit, p.150)
- **Low Centre of Gravity.** +2 to defend with Physique against attempts to trip or grapple you. (Peter Blake)
- **Scrum.** You may roll Physique to push yourself and an opponent into an adjacent zone, provided there are no situation aspects impeding movement. Your opponent may defend with either Athletics or Physique. (Peter Blake)

### Stress and Consequences

- **Face the Pain.** (requires Feel the Burn.) You are able to lessen the effects of physical injury thanks to your incredible stamina. Once per scene, you may spend a fate point, and uncheck any one of your physical stress boxes. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.1)
- **Feel the Burn.** You can push through incredible pain in order to reach your goal. You gain an additional mild consequence slot. This slot can only be used for physical harm. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.1)
- **Man of Iron.** (requires Thick Skinned.) When you take physical stress, and the stress box with a value equal to the shift value of the hit is already checked, you may instead mark the next lowest value box that is unchecked. Very simply, this means that you don’t start picking up consequences unless someone hits you for more than your highest value box (difficult at best!) or all of your boxes are filled up. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.3)
- **One Hit to the Body.** When you take physical stress, you may check off two stress boxes with a total value equal to or greater than the shift value of the hit. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.3)
- **Thick Skinned.** (requires One Hit to the Body.) You gain one more physical stress box. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.3)
- **Tough as Nails.** Once per session, at the cost of a fate point, you can reduce the severity of a moderate consequence that’s physical in nature to a mild consequence (if your mild consequence slot is free), or erase a mild consequence altogether. (Fate Core, p.119)

### Wrestling

- **Grappler.** +2 to Physique rolls made to create advantages on an enemy by wrestling or grappling with them. (Fate Core, p.119)
- **Hammerlock.** (requires Wrestler.) Whenever you have hold of someone and they fail to overcome your hold, you deal 1 shift of physical stress to them. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.19.2)
- **Unbound/Clever Wrestling.** You aren't easy to hold down. +2 to overcome with Physique whenever you are physically restrained in some fashion - for example by chains or a mob of people. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.19.1, and [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### New Actions

- **Bounce Back.** You may roll Physique instead of Lore when performing a physical recovery action on yourself. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.2)
- **Fling Foe.** You may roll Physique to throw an enemy you have _Picked Up_ into an adjacent zone. You must overcome any situation aspects that impede the enemy’s movement. (Peter Blake)
- **Heavy Object Swing.** Sometimes pure strength can compensate pretty well for a lack of skill. You may use Physique instead of Fight whenever you use a heavy object as a melee weapon. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Heavy Object Throw.** (requires Heavy Object Swing.) If you spin a weight fast enough, it can become airborne. You may use Physique instead of Shoot to attack targets one zone away with a heavy object. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Mighty Pull.** You can use Physique to create advantages related to your ability to draw bows back further than most, granting extra force to the arrow or bolt. (Peter Blake)
- **Muscle Your Way Up.** Climbing is basically like weightlifting, except you are the weight. You may use Physique in place of Athletics when climbing. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Piledriver.** (requires Herculean Strength.) You may make attacks against inanimate targets using Physique instead of Fight. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.19.1)
- **Shield Sling.** When armed with a shield, you may attack an opponent one zone away with Physique, but doing so places the aspect _No Shield_ on you. (Peter Blake)
- **Take the Blow.** You can use Physique to defend against Fight attacks made with fists or blunt instruments, though you always take 1 shift of stress on a tie. (Fate Core, p.119)
- **Toughness of Mind and Body.** A guy as tough as you has no need to be afraid. You may use Physique instead of Will to defend against fear. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Unstoppable.** (requires Herculean Strength and at least one other Physique stunt.) Once in motion, you are very difficult to stop due to your sheer muscular force. You may use Physique rather than Athletics to move between zones. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.19.1)
- **Wrestler/Power Over Finesse.** Your unarmed attacks rely on brute strength rather than on technique. You may make such attacks against other humans with Physique rather than Fight. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.19.2, and [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### Other

- **Bend Bars, Lift Gates.** You may spend a fate point to automatically overcome a Physique obstacle, even if you’ve already rolled for it, provided you’re trying to accomplish something through brute strength. (Fate System Toolkit, p.41)
- **Charge Like Ox.** Because you are _Strong Like Ox_, once per scene, as a single action, you may move two zones in a straight line then make a physical attack. (Fate System Toolkit, p.34)
- **Favored Enemy Tackle.** Choose an organisation. You gain +2 to create advantage with Physique against members of that group. (Peter Blake)
- **Give As Good As I Get.** Sometimes you have to do something crazy in order to win a fight. Once per conflict, when you take physical stress, you may choose to incur an additional physical consequence. In exchange, you may create a situation aspect on your opponent with a number of free invocations: two for a minor consequence, three for a moderate, four for a severe. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Herculean Strength.** +2 to overcome or create advantage rolls with Physique that involve lifting great weights. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.19.1)
- **Hulking Rage.** While you have the aspect _Enraged_ on you, you gain +2 to overcome and create advantage with Physique. (Peter Blake)
- **None Shall Pass.** +2 to defend with Physique against attempts to move past you. (Peter Blake)
- **Now You've Made Me Mad.** (requires two other Endurance stunts.) Once per scene, after taking physical stress, you may spend a fate point to add the shift value of the attack (after any reduction by consequences) as a bonus to an action in the next exchange taken against the person who inflicted the stress. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.11.3)
- **Smashing Rage.** While you have the aspect _Enraged_ on you, you gain +2 to break inanimate objects with Physique. (Peter Blake)
- **Trample.** Once per scene, when you succeed with style on a create advantage roll with Physique and place an aspect on an opponent, you may exchange one of your free invocations for a 2-shift hit on that opponent. (Peter Blake)

## Provoke Stunts

### Intimidation

- **Aura of Fear.** (requires Aura of Menace.) Your intimidating appearance and attitude are potent, making you able to intimidate entire crowds. Once per scene, you may spend a fate point and make an intimidation attempt against all opponents in the scene. If you succeed, attach an aspect representing the intimidation to each opponent. (This doesn't get you any additional free invocations of these aspects.) (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.2)
- **Aura of Menace.** (requires Scary.) You are the terror of all those who oppose you. Once per scene per target, you may spend a fate point to intimidate a target as a free action, no matter what the circumstances, immediately (if between actions), or immediately after the current action underway. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.2)
- **Crown of Menace.** You are too terrifying to be attacked. Until you make a physical attack in a scene, characters with a Will lower than Good (+3) simply cannot attack you. Those with sufficient Will to attack still flinch on their first attack, though, automatically missing. (Fate System Toolkit, p.98)
- **Daunting Presence.** +2 to create advantages similar to _Daunted_ with Provoke. (Peter Blake)
- **Fearsome Gaze.** (requires Steely Gaze.) Your gaze is so terrifying that those faced with it can end up paralyzed with fear. This stunt is used in the same fashion as Steely Gaze, but if your opponent loses to the point of taking a consequence, he takes other consequences immediately afterwards. Even if this means he’s taken out, the target retains the option to concede after recording the consequence. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.2)
- **Master of Fear.** (requires Fearsome Gaze and Aura of Fear.) You are a master of the terrifying, and can have an entire room cowering within moments. Nameless NPCs who are affected by your Aura of Fear are automatically taken out; they simply flee or faint. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.2)
- **Menacing Demeanor.** When you are face-to-face with another person, gain +2 to create advantages specifically related to fear on them with Provoke. (Peter Blake)
- **Subtle Menace.** You exude menace far in excess of your capability to act. Even bound and behind prison bars, you are so ripe with the promise of the awful things you could do that you're still scary. +2 to Provoke rolls when opposed by someone in a clearly superior position of power. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.1)

### Rage

- **Berserk Rage.** When you suffer a physical consequence, you can invoke that consequence for free on your next attack. If you suffer multiple physical consequences, you get a free invocation for each. (Fate System Toolkit, p.34)

### Satire and Mockery

- **Infuriate.** Sometimes fear isn’t an option, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still get up someone’s nose. +2 to Provoke rolls whenever deliberately trying to get someone angry with you. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.1)
- **Master of Mockery.** When you place an aspect such as _Enraged with <Your Name Here>_ on an opponent, that opponent can do nothing but attack you until the aspect is overcome. (Peter Blake)
- **Poison Words.** (requires Razor Tongue.) Your skill at satire is so profound that you can take a whole audience with you. During a satirical performance, advantages you create with Provoke attach to each character present. You choose to which person your free invocations apply. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.4.3)
- **Razor Tongue.** You know how to craft the most exquisite insults. +2 to create advantage with Provoke whenever you eloquently insult a rival. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.4.3)
- **Teflon Troublemaker.** When your _Can’t Keep His Big Mouth Shut_ aspect is compelled to make you the target of an attack, you may immediately clear any mild consequences you currently have, instead of taking a fate point. (Fate System Toolkit, p.34)

### Seduction

(even though, strictly speaking, the response to seduction isn't a "negative emotional response".)

- **Ladies' Man/Popular Gal.** You’re adept at catching the eye of the opposite sex, and keeping it once you’ve got it. Any seduction attempts you make with Provoke receive a +2 bonus whenever the target is someone who could be receptive to it (this is not always a simple case of gender and preference). (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.22.1)

### New Actions

- **Armor of Fear.** You can use Provoke to defend against Fight attacks, but only until the first time you’re dealt stress in a conflict. You can make your opponents hesitate to attack, but when someone shows them that you’re only human your advantage disappears. (Fate Core, p.120)
- **The Fight in the Dog.** You can use Provoke to enter the kinds of contests that you’d normally need Physique for, whenever your ability to psych your opponent out with the force of your presence alone would be a factor. (Fate Core, p.89)
- **Imposing Attitude.** For some reason, people seem reluctant to disagree with you. Maybe it’s your cologne. You may use Provoke instead of Rapport to defend attempts to damage your reputation. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Okay, Fine!** You can use Provoke in place of Empathy to learn a target’s aspects, by bullying them until they reveal one to you. The target defends against this with Will. (If the GM thinks the aspect is particularly vulnerable to your hostile approach, you get a +2 bonus.) (Fate Core, p.120)
- **Scary.** You are just someone people don’t want to cross, and that’s clear even to other intimidating folks. You may use Provoke instead of Will to defend against Provoke. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.2)
- **The Serpent's Tongue.** (requires Subtle Menace.) It’s hard not to talk to you. Not because you're approachable, but because it seems like such a bad idea not to. Fear makes people uncomfortable, and they occasionally let things slip they would not otherwise. You may use Provoke in place of Empathy or Rapport when trying to get information out of someone in a “softer” fashion. If successfully used in this way, the target is definitely rattled – so it certainly doesn’t leave the target in the same pleasant state he might be left by one of those other skills. If used to read a character's emotional state, the aspects revealed are limited only to those which might be expressed in the language of fear. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.1)
- **Tell Me or Else!** You don't ask nicely when there's stuff you need to know. You may roll Provoke instead of Contacts when you are gathering information from your informants. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Unapproachable.** It’s difficult to try to manipulate someone when you’re constantly reminded of how scary they are. You may use Provoke instead of Will to provide defend against create advantage actions made with Deceive, Empathy, or Rapport. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.1)

### Other

- **Bad Cop.** Cruelty is more effective when given a basis for comparison. Once per scene, gain +2 to Provoke when invoking an aspect created by someone who has the Good Cop stunt. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Berate the Underlings.** +2 to create advantage or attack with Provoke when you interact with your subordinates. (Peter Blake)
- **Favored Enemy Rattle.** Choose an organisation. You gain +2 to attack or create advantage with Provoke against members of that group. (Peter Blake)
- **Not to Be Trifled With.** When you make it clear how dangerous you are, roll Provoke against your target’s Will. If you succeed, that target will not attack you or willingly come near you unless you take action against him first. If you succeed with style, neither will anyone with a lower Will than your target. (Fate System Toolkit, p.35)
- **Provoke Violence.** When you create an advantage on an opponent using Provoke, you can use your free invocation to become the target of that character’s next relevant action, drawing their attention away from another target. (Fate Core, p.120)
- **Scare 'Em Straight.** You are an authority figure. Part of your job is to put the fear of the law in potential miscreants. +2 to Provoke when using it to frighten someone under your authority (e.g. students for a teacher). (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **The Promise of Pain.** (requires Scary.) Once per conflict, you can force the opponent to use a mild consequence instead of a 2-point stress box on a successful Provoke attack. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.2)
- **Steely Gaze.** (requires Scary.) Your unflinching gaze can lock an opponent in place. When you look an opponent in the eyes and successfully create an advantage with Provoke, both of you can only take Provoke actions against each other until one of you takes a consequence, concedes, or is interrupted (by, say, a gunshot). (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.16.2)
- **Street Talk.** +2 to Provoke when dealing with the inhabitants of slums. (Peter Blake)
- **Torturer.** You have the complete lack of mercy that is needed to torture someone properly. Once per scene, when you force an opponent to take a consequence instead of mental stress, you can spend a fate point to increase the consequence’s severity (so mild becomes moderate, moderate becomes severe). If your opponent was already going to take a severe consequence, he must either take a severe consequence and a second consequence or be taken out. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Wounds From a Friend.** It's hard to disbelieve what those closest to you tell you. While successfully impersonating someone, your successful Provoke attacks on their close associates inflict two additional stress. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

## Rapport Stunts

### Art

- **Do You Know Who I Am?** (requires Virtuoso.) Once per scene, you may identify yourself in order to get your way and add +2 to a Contacts, Deceive, Provoke, or Rapport roll. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.4.4)
- **Moving Performance.** (requires Virtuoso.) When you create an advantage with Rapport using your art, the difficulty of removing the resulting aspect increases by +2. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.4.2)
- **Stage Presence.** (requires Virtuoso.) +2 to overcome distractions with Rapport while performing. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.4.3)
- **Virtuoso/Artist.** Choose a field of art, such as painting, composition, or singing. You get a +2 to all Rapport rolls relating to that art. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.4.2)

### Oratory

- **Demagogue.** +2 to Rapport when you’re delivering an inspiring speech in front of a crowd. (If there are named NPCs or PCs in the scene, you may target them all simultaneously with one roll rather than dividing up your shifts.) (Fate Core, p.121)
- **Excellent Speaker.** Public speaking is an everyday thing to you. +2 to Rapport whenever you make a formal speech to a group. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))

### Specific Audiences

- **Another Round?** +2 to Rapport when drinking with someone in a tavern. (Fate Core, p.298)
- **Blood is Thicker Than Water.** +2 to Rapport when dealing with members of your extended family. (Peter Blake)
- **Captain’s Word.** Once per scene, you may roll Rapport to command your crew as a free action. (Peter Blake)
- **Child of the Court.** Gain a +2 bonus to any attempt to overcome obstacles with Rapport when you’re at an aristocratic function, such as a royal ball. (Fate Core, p.90)
- **Good Cop.** Kindness is more effective when given a basis for comparison. +2 to Rapport when creating advantages to assist someone who has the Bad Cop stunt. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Honest Salesman.** Making a sale comes as naturally to you as breathing. +2 to Rapport when using it to sell goods or services. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Master of the Mob.** +2 to Rapport when dealing with a crowd or mob. (Peter Blake)
- **Negotiator.** +2 to Rapport when you try to broker an end to an armed conflict. (Peter Blake)
- **Scion of the Court.** (requires Child of the Court.) When you overcome an obstacle with Child of the Court, you may additionally create a situation aspect that describes how the general attitude turns in your favor. If anyone wants to try and get rid of this aspect, they must overcome Fair (+2) opposition. (Fate Core, p.94)
- **Target Audience.** Pick a specific field of endeavour, such as crime, business, politics, espionage, or the occult. Gain +2 to Rapport rolls whenever dealing with someone from that field. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.7.2)

### New Actions

- **All the World's a Stage/Playing to Expectations.** (requires one other Rapport stunt.) Your acting talent is natural and unquestionable. You may roll Rapport instead of Deceive when convincing a target you are someone you aren't. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.4.3)
- **Animal Whisperer.** You may use Rapport instead of Lore to issue commands to animals. (Peter Blake)
- **Blather.** It’s not that you’re a good liar – possibly far from it. It’s more that you have a skill at talking so fast, and not letting the other guy get a word in edgewise, that he doesn’t ever get the chance to figure out if you’re lying or not. You may create an aspect such as _Blathering_ on yourself which justifies active opposition to Alertness rolls in your zone. You cannot take other actions while blathering, but you may spend a fate point to negate any successful roll that overcomes the aspect. The targets of this effort are by no means helpless – if they are attacked or otherwise disturbed they may respond normally, and they will respond to obvious stimuli (friends being attacked in their line of sight, fire alarms going off and such). However, they are definitely distracted. Once you stop talking, it may be time for a quick exit. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.22.2)
- **Commissions.** (requires Virtuoso.) Your works and performances are heavily sought out, and there are those who will pay handsomely for it. Once per session, you may use Rapport in place of Resources for one roll, representing a successful past commission. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.4.4)
- **Large Ham.** You may use Rapport in place of Provoke to intimidate someone. (Peter Blake)
- **Popular.** If you’re in an area where you’re popular and well-liked, you can use Rapport in place of Contacts. You may be able to establish your popularity by spending a fate point to declare a story detail, or because of prior justification. (Fate Core, p.121)
- **The Right Questions.** Smaller parts of a larger truth can contain a blueprint of the whole – and as a skilled conversationalist, you are adept at pulling the larger truth out of a single individual. Provided the person you’re talking to is at least neutral towards you, you may use your Rapport skill instead of Contacts for any effort to network. The results are limited and colored by the knowledge available to the person with whom you speak. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.22.2)
- **Weight of Reputation.** (requires Do You Know Who I Am?) For a fate point, you may use Empathy in place of Contacts, Deceive or Provoke, provided those you are dealing with are aware of your reputation. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.4.4)

### Other

- **All Things in Their Place.** You always know the power dynamic in the room, and you may insert yourself within it anywhere you desire. Use this with caution—while it impacts how people interact with you, it does not equate to actual authority, and placing yourself too highly—especially over people not used to being anything but top dog—can inspire an unpleasant response. (Fate System Toolkit, p.98)
- **Best Foot Forward.** Twice per session, you may upgrade a boost you receive with Rapport into a full situation aspect with a free invocation. (Fate Core, p.121)
- **First Impressions.** Whenever an opponent succeeds with style against the first Rapport roll you make in a scene, they do not gain a boost. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.22.1)
- **Five Minutes Friends.** For a fate point, you can make a steadfast friend in a place you’ve never been, given a chance for five minutes of conversation. This stunt makes nearly impossible opportunities to make friends merely improbable, improbable opportunities probable, and probable opportunities outright certain. (Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.22.1)
- **Heart on My Sleeve.** You’re a regular stand up guy with no secrets, at least so far as anyone can tell. But even so, you’re in control of which part of your best face you’re putting forward. +2 to defend with Rapport against attempts to read your emotional state. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.22.2)
- **International.** Your mastery of etiquette leaves you comfortable, and even glib, in any situation. You never suffer any increased difficulty from unfamiliarity with your setting, making it easy to maneuver through local customs you haven’t encountered before, and to cover up any gaffes with a laugh and a sparkle in your eye. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.22.1)
- **Rustic Charm.** You suffer no increased difficulty on Rapport rolls due to your social class. (Peter Blake)
- **Smooth Over.** You’re adept at stepping into a bad situation and dialing it down to something more reasonable. So long as you are not the direct reason someone is upset, your attempts to calm them down using your Rapport receive a +2 bonus. (Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.22.2)

## Resources Stunts

(Stunts related to business are included here, on the basis that wealth and the skills to manage that wealth go together.)

### New Actions

- **Grease the Wheels.** You can use Resources instead of Rapport in any situation where bribes will be accepted. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.24.1)
- **Help Wanted, Reward Offered.** You can use Resources instead of Contacts whenever you make it public exactly what or who you are looking for. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.24.1)
- **Glitterati.** Money can, in fact, buy friends. You may use Resources in place of Contacts when in high society. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Instant Functionary.** You’re skilled at seeing the shape of an organization from the underside, and in organizations of sufficient size, you can easily convince anyone that you’re just another cog in the machine. This allows you to substitute your Resources skill for Deceive whenever pretending to fill the role of a minor functionary of a target organization. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.18.3)
- **Money Talks.** You can use Resources instead of Rapport in any situation where ostentatious displays of material wealth might aid your cause. (Fate Core, p.123)
- **My Wallet Has A Lot To Say.** (requires Money Talks.) +2 to Resources whenever you use the Money Talks stunt. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **War of Papers.** You can take action against organizations through indirect measures. Effectively you can fight on the level of any organization smaller than a nation without the need to recruit allies or have any organization of your own. Yes, this means you can effectively “kill” a city, or even an army, given enough time. (Fate System Toolkit, p.98)

### Other

- **Best That Money Can Buy.** You have a discerning taste and a natural instinct for spending your money to get exactly the best and nothing less. You are at +2 to your Resources whenever making a purchase of something that would be considered “the best.” While this may seem like a discount, it’s not, really, since seeking out the best may mandate a price mark several steps above the baseline; still, this stunt helps to soften the blow. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.24.3)
- **Long Term Investment.** You’ve had your money for a while now, and you’ve had a chance to make several strategic investments which you can cash in on when pressed for money. Once per session, you may sell one of these investments to get a +2 to any one Resources roll. (Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.24.3)
- **Licenses for Everything.** You suffer no increased penalties on Resources rolls related to legal restrictions on goods. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Money Is No Object.** (requires two other Resources stunts.) Once per session, when called on to roll Resources, you may spend a fate point and simply act as if you had rolled +4 on the dice. You may do this after the fact on a roll. Your Resources skill will then operate at -2 for the rest of the session; you’ve simply tapped into everything at your disposal to make the purchase. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.24.3)
- **Rivers of Gold.** Money is just a detail to you. Stripped naked and cast on a desert island, and you’ll be living in luxury in short order. Cast into prison, and you’ll be bribing guards in no time. No situation will restrict your access to your Resources skill. (Fate System Toolkit, p.98)
- **Savvy Investor.** You get an additional free invoke when you create advantages with Resources, provided that they describe a monetary return on an investment you made in a previous session. (In other words, you can’t retroactively declare that you did it, but if it happened in the course of play, you get higher returns.) (Fate Core, p.123)
- **Trust Fund Baby.** Twice per session, you may take a boost representing a windfall or influx of cash. (Fate Core, p.123)
- **Useful Little Things.** Your pockets are full of useful little things. Whenever you need something, you have it, provided it’s not something _too_ unusual (like a map to Jimmy Hoffa’s body) or too large to fit in a pocket, belt pouch, or backpack. When you say you have something, the GM should be likely to agree. (Fate System Toolkit, p.34)
- **Wholesale Pricing.** Pick a type of business (e.g. supermarket, sporting goods, electronics). You gain +2 to Resources when you attempt to purchase something which that business sells. (Peter Blake)

## Shoot Stunts

### Aiming

- **Scope User.** You know how to use a scope. +2 to create advantages with Shoot related to aiming while using a scope or laser sight. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Uncanny Accuracy.** Once per conflict, stack an additional free invoke on an advantage you’ve created to represent the time you take to aim or line up a shot (like _In My Sights_). (Fate Core, p.125)

### Ammunition

- **Fast Reload.** +2 to Shoot whenever you roll to overcome an aspect of _Out of Ammunition_ or similar that has been placed upon you. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.2)
- **Lead in the Air.** You really like emptying magazines. Any time you’re using a fully automatic weapon and you succeed at a Shoot attack, you automatically create a Fair (+2) opposition against movement in that zone until your next turn, because of all the lead in the air. (Normally, you’d need to take a separate action to set up this kind of interference, but with the stunt, it’s free.) (Fate Core, p.90)
- **One Shot Left (or Empty Mag, Empty Room).** That last bullet has a kind of magic to it. Once per scene, you may create an aspect of _One Shot Left_ (equivalently, _The Whole Magazine at Once_) on yourself as a free action. You may invoke this aspect once for free, but doing so changes the aspect to _Out of Ammunition_. The Fast Reload stunt explicitly cannot be used to overcome this aspect. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.2, and [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Rain of Lead.** +2 to create advantage rolls with Shoot when you create an aspect relating to suppressive fire. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.2)

### Indirect Shots

- **Crazy Ricochet.** When you use the Ricochet stunt, you may invoke further aspects to represent further bounces, gaining a bonus for each as normal. (Peter Blake)
- **Fortunate Rebound/Through and Through.** Once per scene, when you succeed with style on a Shoot attack, you may inflict a 2-shift physical hit on another opponent in the same zone instead of gaining a boost. (Peter Blake)
- **Ricochet.** You may invoke a relevant situation aspect to bounce a projectile off a solid surface, allowing it to come at an opponent from an unexpected direction. (This invocation does not provide its normal bonus.) If your attack is successful, the stress of the hit is increased by 2. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.29.2)

### Long Range

- **Good Arm.** You have an amazing throwing arm, and can throw weapons with great force. If thrown weapons have a shorter range in your game than guns, this stunt extends that range to two zones, equal to that of guns. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.29.2)
- **Legendary Archer.** Bows are not just weapons, they're your weapons of choice. When wielding a bow or crossbow, you can make attacks with it from two additional zones away. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Long Shot.** You can make physical attacks with Shoot from up to three zones away, rather than the usual two. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.1)
- **Sniper.** Once per scene, you may make an attack with Shoot from up to ten zones away, provided you have a sniper rifle and scope. (Peter Blake)

### Specific Targets

- **Feller of Fauna.** To you, guns aren't for killing people; they're for killing animals. +2 to Shoot attacks against mundane animals. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Game Hunter’s Finger.** Choose a type of animal. You gain +2 to attack with Shoot against that kind of animal. (Peter Blake)
- **Trick Shot.** +2 to create advantage with Shoot when firing at an inanimate object. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.1)

### New Actions

- **Gun-Crazy/Way of the Gun.** You may use Shoot instead of Crafts whenever you're working with guns specifically. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.4)
- **Gun Kata.** You are light on your feet with a gun in your hand, able to keep the gunplay going while evading attempts to harm you. You may use Shoot instead of Athletics to defend against physical attacks. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.1)
- **Juggler.** You have a great talent for juggling; this includes the ability to throw around seemingly dangerous objects (knives, torches) without any fear of harm to yourself. +2 to Shoot when using juggling to entertain. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.26.2)
- **Personal Arsenal.** You own a great number of weapons, and you get new ones all the time. Use your Shoot skill instead of your Resources skill when dealing with weaponry. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Quick on the Draw.** You can use Shoot instead of Notice to determine turn order in any physical conflict where shooting quickly would be useful. (Fate Core, p.125)
- **Shot on the Run.** Once per scene, you may move one zone, attack with Shoot, and then move one additional zone, provided there are no situation aspects restricting movement. (Peter Blake)
- **Snap Shot.** (requires Quick on the Draw.) Once per conflict, between or before other characters’ actions, you may spend a fate point to preempt the usual turn order and act next. The action taken must involve a roll with your Shoot skill – usually an attack. This may be done in addition to your normal action. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.3)

### Other

- **Called Shot.** During a Shoot attack, spend a fate point and declare a specific condition you want to inflict on a target, like _Shot in the Hand_. If you succeed, you place that as a situation aspect on them in addition to hitting them for stress. (Fate Core, p.125)
- **Master of the Lasso.** +2 to create advantages with Shoot whenever this involves throwing a lasso. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Ranged Knockback.** When you succeed with style on a Shoot attack with a thrown weapon, you may choose to reduce the value of your hit by one in order to move your opponent one zone, provided there are no situation aspects impeding this movement. (Peter Blake)
- **Subtle Draw.** +2 to Shoot whenever there is active opposition to your first shot in a scene. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.3)
- **Trained As a Unit/Team Player.** You were trained alongside the rest of your unit, and now that unit is like a single organism. +2 to create advantages with Shoot whenever working with another character who is from the same unit as you and who also has this stunt. (A similar stunt could exist in many other skills.) (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Two Gun Joe.** Normally, shooting with two guns just looks cool, but when you fire two weapons, you have a decisive advantage. Any time you succeed on an attack with two guns, the stress inflicted is increased by one. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.15.4)
- **Volley.** When you combine Shoot skills with your allies, you contribute an additional +1 bonus. (Peter Blake)

## Stealth Stunts

### In Specific Environments

- **Face in the Crowd.** +2 to any Stealth roll to blend into a crowd. What a “crowd” means will depend on the environment—a subway station requires more people to be crowded than a small bar. (Fate Core, p.126)
- **Gently Does It.** Your Stealth skill works impeded by inanimate objects that will make sound if disturbed, such as brittle twigs, mouse traps, or wobbly piles of crates. (Peter Blake)
- **Slip Between the Shadows.** +2 to create advantage or overcome with Stealth whenever you are in near-darkness or total darkness. (Peter Blake)
- **Stowaway.** +2 to Stealth when hiding on a ship or other large vehicle. (Peter Blake)

### Sudden Disappearances

- **Cunning Evasion.** Once per scene, when you successfully defend against an area attack with Athletics, you may roll to create an advantage with Stealth as a free action. (Peter Blake)
- **Hidden Sniper.** Once per scene, after you make a Shoot attack, you may roll to create advantage with Stealth as a free action. (Peter Blake)
- **Only the Wind Will See Me Go.** At the cost of a fate point, you may exit a scene, passing from sight. (Fate System Toolkit, p.96)
- **Quick Exit.** A momentary distraction is all you need to vanish from the scene. Provided you are not in the midst of a conflict, you may roll a quick contest between your Stealth and the highest Notice in the room. If you succeed, the next time someone turns to look at or talk to you, you’re not there. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.27.2)

### New Actions

- **Backstab/Sucker Punch.** You can use Stealth to make physical attacks, provided your target isn’t already aware of your presence. (Fate Core, p.89)
- **Backstab.** When you can surprise an enemy or attack from a place of hiding, you can attack with Stealth. If you succeed, you create a boost. If you succeed with style, you get to invoke that boost for free twice. (Fate System Toolkit, p.42)
- **In Plain Sight.** You can use Stealth to hide even when you're out in the open and wouldn’t normally be able to justify it. However, as soon as you move, you become visible again, unless another stunt you have states otherwise. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.27.1)
- **Ninja Vanish.** Once per scene, you can vanish while in plain sight by spending a fate point, using a smoke pellet or other mysterious technique. This places the _Vanished_ boost on you. While you’re vanished, no one can attack or create an advantage on you until after they’ve succeeded at an overcome roll with Notice to suss out where you went (basically meaning they have to give up an exchange to try). This aspect goes away as soon as you invoke it, or someone makes that overcome roll. (Fate Core, p.126)
- **Shadowed Strike.** (requires Master of Shadows and Ninja Vanish.) After you invoke _Vanished_ on an attack, you may defend with Stealth for the remainder of the current exchange. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.27.1)
- **Slippery Target.** Provided you’re in darkness or shadow, you can use Stealth to defend against Shoot attacks from enemies that are at least one zone away. (Fate Core, p.126)
- **Stalker.** You like to watch people who don't know they're being watched. You may use Stealth in place of Investigate to conduct surveillance. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### Other

- **Hush.** Your talent with stealth may be extended to others who are with you close by, provided that you travel as a group. As long as the whole group stays with you and follows your hushed orders, you may make a single Stealth roll for the whole group, using your skill alone. (You cannot apply the benefits of other stunts to this roll.) If someone breaks from the group, they immediately lose the benefits, and may risk revealing the rest of you if they don’t manage to pull off a little Stealth of their own. The maximum number of people that can be with you in the group is equal to your Stealth skill rating. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.27.3)
- **Lightfoot.** It’s difficult to track you when you take care to walk lightly. +2 to Stealth when overcoming traps based on weight or pressure. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.27.3)
- **Master of Shadows.** (requires In Plain Sight.) After you use In Plain Sight, you may move one zone per exchange without becoming visible. If there is an aspect in play that would normally justify the use of Stealth to hide, you may pay a fate point to be able to make an overcome action with Athletics without becoming visible. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.27.1)
- **Not a Threat.** Choose Deceive or Stealth when you take this stunt. When you create an advantage with that skill to make yourself as non-threatening or unobtrusive as possible, enemies will find other targets for as long as that aspect exists. As soon as you successfully attack someone, the aspect goes away. (Fate System Toolkit, p.42)
- **Silent Tank.** For some strange reason, you are capable of sneaking around while wearing 30 pounds of steel plating. You never suffer increased difficulty on Stealth rolls from being armored. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

## Will Stunts

### Mental Resistance

- **Fierce Mind.** +2 to overcome fear with Will. (Peter Blake)
- **Fighting For What You Believe In.** Your faith, in someone or something, is absolute. Pick a being or a concept. +2 to Will when defending that thing or when overcoming separation from it. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikia.com/wiki/Stunts))
- **Gift of Faith.** +2 to defend with Will against fear and despair. (Peter Blake)
- **Indomitable/Fearless.** +2 to defend against Provoke attacks specifically related to intimidation and fear. (Fate Core, p.127)
- **Inner Strength.** +2 to defend with Will against someone trying to get inside your head – be it through psychic means or through extensive torture. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.23.2)
- **Mind of Steel.** Magical mental influence is useless against your fortress-like mind! +2 to Will when using it to defend against supernatural mental attacks. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Set In My Ways.** You're old. It took you decades to form your beliefs and you're not about to abandon them. Add +2 to your Will when using it to resist attempts to change your deeply-held beliefs or your core identity. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Stubborn Faith.** You cling to your beliefs with amazing determination. +2 to Will when overcoming or defending against attempts to make you act directly against the principles of your faith. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Trust In My Leader.** Pick a person or being who has authority over you and whom you trust. You gain +2 to Will whenever you resist attempts to undermine that trust. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### Stress and Consequences

- **Aplomb.** (requires Smooth Recovery.) When you go to check off a mental stress box and that box is already checked, you can check off the next lowest value empty box. If there are no unchecked boxes of a lower value, check off a higher value box as normal. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.23.1)
- **Cool Customer.** (requires Smooth Recovery.) You are so at ease in times of mental stress that nothing seems to dent your calm regard of the situation. During a conflict, you may use your action to roll your Resolve against a target of Mediocre. If you succeed, you may either erase a check in your 1-point mental stress box or spend a fate point to erase a check from any single mental stress box with a value equal to or less than the shifts you gained on your roll. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.23.1)
- **Driven.** (requires Still Standing.) Whenever you take a moderate or severe consequence from a mental attack, you gain a free invocation on that consequence. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.23.2)
- **Hard Boiled.** You can choose to ignore a mild or moderate consequence for the duration of the scene. It can’t be compelled against you or invoked by your enemies. At the end of the scene it comes back worse, though; if it was a mild consequence it becomes a moderate consequence, and if it was already moderate, it becomes severe. (Fate Core, p.127)
- **Never Broken.** You gain a -8 physical consequence which recovers in the same way a -2 consequence does. (Fate System Toolkit, p.95)
- **Smooth Recovery/Still Standing/Stubborn.** (requires Inner Strength.) You simply do not know when to quit. You gain an additional mild consequence slot. This slot can only be used for mental harm. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.23.2)
- **Unyielding.** (requires Driven.) Your force of will is enough to keep you going in the direst of circumstances. Each time you take physical stress, you may spend a fate point to instead take two 1-shift hits of mental stress. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.23.2)

### New Actions

- **Determinate.** Your astonishing determination allows you to push yourself beyond your physical limits. Use Will instead of Physique on any overcome rolls representing feats of endurance. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **I'll Just Ignore You.** Counterarguments are a waste of time. You prefer to simply not listen to the people you disagree with. You may use Will instead of Rapport to defend against attempts to damage your reputation or make you look bad in front of others. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Right Place, Right Time.** (requires Indomitable.) You seem to always be in a safe spot, without moving in any obvious way. You may use Will to defend against physical attacks, and may also use it to move or take cover (so long as you merely saunter; no sprints allowed). To the outside world, it appears that you are simply staying put and unfazed as gunfire and other attacks miss you by scant inches, or are picking up your undisturbed martini as the werewolf rushes past. Circumstance conspires to leave you undisturbed so long as your defense is not beaten. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.23.1)
- **Strength From Determination.** Use Will instead of Physique on any overcome rolls representing feats of strength. (Fate Core, p.127)
- **Sunday School.** Your steadfastness comes from your religious upbringing. You may roll Will instead of Lore whenever seeking or recalling religious knowledge. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **Unbroken Composure.** Your mental strength allows you to remain calm when others would be caught off guard. You may use Will in place of Notice whenever someone is attempting to surprise you. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))

### Other

- **Extraordinary Concentration.** Once per scene, when you successfully create an advantage with Will based on concentration, you gain one additional free invocation. (Peter Blake)
- **Iron Determination.** You may, when you bluntly speak your true intentions in a social interaction, immediately gain a +1 bonus on all subsequent Provoke or Will rolls in that scene. However, if you do this, you may no longer use Rapport with the same audience, as you have peeled away the façade of civility. (adapted from Spirit of the Century SRD, §6.23.2)
- **Laser-Like Focus.** You find it easy to clear your mind in a stressful situation. +2 to create an advantage with Will related to concentration, willpower, or clear thought. (adapted from [http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts](http://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Stunts))
- **The Mind Is the Greatest Mountain.** So far as social skills are concerned, you do not exist. You cannot be swayed, befriended, intimidated, or otherwise moved. Your speech reveals nothing about you or the veracity of your words. (If another character has the stunt The Inner Eye Sees Inner Truth, for the purposes of that stunt, your Deceive score is higher than their Empathy.) (Fate System Toolkit, p.95)
- **Parrot.** You can perfectly repeat anything you’ve heard in the last hour or so, even if you don’t know the language it was spoken in. (Normally a Will roll would be required to recall the words correctly.) (Peter Blake)

# Stunt Rubrics

## Add a New Action to a Skill

> The most basic option for a stunt is to allow a skill to do something that it normally can’t do. It adds a new action onto the base skill in certain situations, for those with this stunt. This new action can be one that’s available to another skill (allowing one skill to swap for another under certain circumstances), or one that’s not available to any skill. (Fate Core, p.89)

## Add a Bonus to an Action

> Another use for a stunt is to give a skill an automatic bonus under a particular, very narrow circumstance, effectively letting a character specialize in something. The circumstance should be narrower than what the normal action allows, and only apply to one particular action or pair of actions.  
> The usual bonus is +2 to the skill total. However, if you want, you can also express the bonus as two shifts of additional effect after the roll succeeds, if that makes more sense. Remember, higher shifts on a roll allow your action to be more effective in certain ways.  
> You can also use this to establish any effect worth two shifts as an additional benefit of succeeding at the skill roll. This might be Fair (+2) passive opposition, the equivalent of a 2-point hit, a mild consequence, or an advantage that takes Fair (+2) opposition to remove. (Fate Core, p.90)

## Create a Rules Exception

> Finally, a stunt can allow a skill to make a single exception, in a narrow circumstance, for any other game rule that doesn’t precisely fit into the category of an action. The Challenges, Contests, and Conflicts chapter is full of different little rules about the circumstances under which a skill can be used and what happens when you use them. Stunts can break those, allowing your character to stretch the boundaries of the possible.  
> The only limit to this is that a stunt can’t change any of the basic rules for aspects in terms of invoking, compelling, and the fate point economy. Those always remain the same. (Fate Core, p.91)

## Other Rubrics

### Flexible Stunts

> In Fate Core, stunts are tied explicitly to skills. What if you want your stunts to be skill-agnostic, or tied to multiple skills, or tied to something else entirely different, like an aspect or piece of gear or a stress track? (Fate System Toolkit, p.34)

#### Aspected Stunts

> For stunts which are tied to aspects, you might view some of their effects as narrowly defined free invocations. Other aspected stunts might require an invocation, as **Ally’s Shield** does, but give something extra or particularly unusual when the aspect is invoked. Such effects should be more potent than a “vanilla” invocation. You could even design a stunt that triggers under particular kinds of compels —just be careful you don’t end up neutering the downside with the resulting benefit. (Fate System Toolkit, p.34)

### Triggered Effects

> When you use this stunt mechanic, you create stunts that trigger under a specific narrative condition, require a skill roll, and have a specific effect as a result. Stunts like this are a great way to encourage players to do the kinds of things you want to see them do in the game, as those stunts directly reward doing those things. (Fate System Toolkit, p.35)

### Broad Stunts

> If you’re looking for more variety in your stunts than a +2 or its equivalent, consider the idea of a broad stunt that offers a +1 to two or three things. These could be three different actions within the same skill, or could branch across multiple related skills. If you’re going to allow broad stunts like this, watch out for the overlaps in stunt combinations: you don’t want two broad stunts giving the net effect of three +2s for the price of only two stunts. (Fate System Toolkit, p.35)

### Combined Stunts

> If you want to offer particularly potent stunts, consider bundling the benefit of multiple stunts together to produce a single big effect. For example, you could create a stunt that provides a monstrous 4-shift effect —that’s a combination of two stunts, and as such would cost two refresh. (You may recognize this as the method used for constructing the supernatural powers in _The Dresden Files_ RPG.) This kind of focused benefit can throw a game out of whack quickly, though. Consider limiting access to such “super-stunts,” either in quantity—e.g., “everyone only gets one double-stunt”—or in selection and permission—“only these stunts are available to werewolves.” (Fate System Toolkit, p.35)

# Alertness

**Attention!:** You have been trained to follow orders instantly in combat. When in a physical conflict, you may replace your initiative with that of a friendly character with this stunt.  
**The Advantage Of Familiarity:** There are benefits to knowing a place really well. Pick a location or a small neighbourhood. Add two to your Alertness skill while you are in this area.  
**Sentry:** You have the ability to wait, devoting your full effort to watchfulness, for hours on end. Your Endurance skill never restricts your Alertness skill owing to a lack of rest. In addition, add one to your Alertness skill when using its Passive Awareness and Avoiding Surprise trappings while in the same zone that you were in during the previous exchange.  
**Notice Tell:** Your keen senses allow you to pick up on the subtle clues that indicate when a person is lying. You may use your Alertness skill to defend against Deceit-based social maneuvers and attacks.  
**Master of the Tell:** (Requires Notice Tell) Long practice has made you incomparably good at noticing the mannerisms that accompany deception. Add two to your Alertness skill when using it to defend against Deceit-based maneuvers and attacks.  
**Primitive Tracker:** Your methods of tracking are simple and intuitive, but nonetheless effective. You may use your Alertness skill for the Tracking trapping of Survival.  
**Inspector:** Short-term and long term inspection of something are essentially the same thing. You may use your Alertness skill for the Examination trapping of Investigation.  
**Notice the Unseen:** You have an uncanny knack for noticing things that are magically hidden. Add three to your Alertness skill when using it to notice things that are either invisible or veiled.  
  
# Athletics

**War Mount:** You work together with your rider in order to defend yourselves. Add two to your Athletics skill when using it for defense while being ridden.  
**Protector:** You are an expert at the protection of others. Add two to your Athletics skill when using it to create a block to protect another character. (A similar stunt could exist in many other skills.)  
**Ball Toss:** Throwing a basketball isn't very different from throwing a knife. You may use your Athletics skill to wield thrown weapons. You do not get any bonus from speed powers for these attacks.  
**Spell Sense:** Through exposure to and training against spellcasters you have developed a nearly preternatural awareness of danger from magical attacks. As such, you can react to that danger sooner and more effectively. Add two to your Athletics skill when using it to defend against spellcasting (including enchanted items).  
**Reading the Line of Fire:** You can tell where the bullets will go before the trigger is pulled. Add two to your Athletics skill when using it to dodge gunfire.  
**I Grew Up Doing This:** You are very familiar with a certain environment, and you find it easy to navigate its obstacles. Pick an environment. Add two to your Athletics skill when using it to bypass barriers in that environment. For the purposes of this stunt, a valid environment is any area or type of area that you expect to spend a significant amount of time outside of.  
**Highly Mobile:** You move abnormally easily, and you find it easy to do other things while moving. You may move one zone each turn as a supplemental action without taking the normal -1 penalty.  
**Evasion:** Like the members of certain character classes from Dungeons And Dragons (version 3.5), you have an amazing ability to remain unharmed when caught within the area of effect of an explosion. Add two to your Athletics-based defence rolls against area attacks.  
**Unhindered Defences:** Armor and weapons are wonderful things, but they tend to slow a fellow down. So you don't carry weapons or wear armor. Add two to your Athletics defence rolls as long as you are unarmed and unarmored.  
**Land On Your Feet:** Like a cat, you are able to fall from great heights without great harm. When making an Athletics roll to resist falling damage, do not halve the result before converting it to armor.  
**Spring-Heeled:** Maybe you don't actually have springs in your heels, but it sure looks as though you do. Add two to your Athletics skill when using it to jump.  
**Fight By Jumping:** (Requires Spring-Heeled) It is normally a very bad idea to jump up high while fighting, but you make it work. Increase your Athletics skill by a further two when making a jump-based maneuver in combat, but all aspects created this way are automatically fragile.  
**Out Of Reach:** (Requires Fight By Jumping) It isn't easy to hit a guy who's five feet above your head. So long as you possess an aspect created through Fight By Jumping, add two to your defence rolls against melee attacks.  
**The §$%& Bastard Will Not Escape:** Nobody gets away from you. Add two to your Athletics skill when using it to chase someone.  
**Run Away:** Discretion is the better part of valour, at least for you. On a successful defence with Athletics, you may sacrifice your next action to turn that defense roll into an immediate Sprint action.  
**Graceful Silence:** Your natural poise and grace enable you to pass quietly and undetected. You may use your Athletics skill for the Skulking trapping of the Stealth skill.  
**Deadly Grace:** Your speed and agility let you take people down before they realise what's going on. You may use your Athletics skill for the Ambush trapping of the Stealth skill.  
**Like a Ninja:** You've seen enough fights to know that dodging is the best way to go. Gain a +2 to Athletics when dodging.  
  
# Burglary

**Security Expert:** Knowing how to case a place means that you know how to protect a place against other people with the same idea. You may use your Burglary skill to perform blocks against the future use of Burglary upon a target that you have successfully assessed with the Casing trapping. This block represents your efforts to correct the security flaws that you notice. Its duration and the time taken to set it up will vary according to the GM's discretion.  
**Five-Fingered Discount:** Why buy what you can steal? You may use your Burglary skill instead of your Resources skill to “buy” things. Everything “bought” this way has the aspect “Stolen Property”. The difficulty of an attempt to “buy” something with Burglary may or may not be the same as the difficulty of an attempt to buy that same thing with Resources, at the GM's discretion. The time required may also vary.  
**Specialized Criminal:** Thieves have specialties, just like scientists. Pick a type of thing that can be burgled (eg. banks, apartments). Add two to your Burglary skill when using it against that type of thing.  
**I Lupin!:** Somehow, you can always pull of a stroke of larcenous brilliance when it really counts. Once per scene, you may spend a Fate Point in order to get a +4 bonus to a Burglary roll.  
**Burglar's Signature:** Some aspect of your character makes you an expert thief. Pick one of your aspects. Add two to the result of any Burglary roll that you invoke that aspect on.  
**Disable Device:** If you can take apart a lock, you can take apart a clock. You may use your Burglary skill for the Breaking trapping of the Craftsmanship skill.  
  
# Contacts

**Absolute Authority:** You are good at being in charge. Add two to your Contacts skill as long as you are in a position of authority over those you intend to contact.  
**Friends Everywhere:** Your network of contacts extends around the world. You may ignore up to two points worth of penalties to your Contacts skill due to an unfamiliar area.  
**Chain of Command:** You are a soldier, and other soldiers answer to you. Add two to your Contacts skill when using it to deal with other soldiers.  
**The Boss:** People do what you say. Add a new trapping called Employment to your Contacts skill. The Employment trapping is used to acquire or already have subordinates, employees, and minions. An employee's relevant skills are generally roughly equal to half of the roll made to hire them. Employees will not perform risky, illegal, or unethical actions unless you take a penalty to your hiring roll in order to find people willing to do risky, illegal, or unethical things. (Similar stunts could exist in Presence and Resources.)  
**Minions, Attack!:** (Requires The Boss) You might not be good at fighting people, but you sure know how to point at a target. This stunt allows you to treat your minions as weapons rather than as independent characters. Minions are wielded with the Contacts skill. The weapon rating, range, and other traits of a group of minions depends on their numbers, quality, and equipment. (Similar stunts could exist in Presence and Resources.)  
**Minions, Defend!:** (Requires Minions, Attack!) Your loyal minions defend you capably. As long as you have minions present, you may use your Contacts skill for the Dodging trapping of the Athletics skill. (Similar stunts could exist in Presence and Resources.)  
**Coordinated Attack:** (Requires Minions, Attack!) Your expert leadership helps your minions hit their targets. Add one to your Contacts skill when using it with the benefits of Minions, Attack!. (Similar stunts could exist in Presence and Resources.)  
**Morale Boost:** (Requires Minions, Attack!) Your inspiring leadership makes your minions attack more enthusiastically. Add two to the weapon rating of your minions. (Similar stunts could exist in Presence and Resources.)  
**Human Wall:** (Requires Minions, Defend!) As long as your minions are around, you're safe. Even in the center of a battlefield. Add two to your Contacts skill when using it with the benefits of Minions, Defend!. (Similar stunts could exist in Presence and Resources.)  
**My Buddy Has One Of Those:** Your friends are very willing to let you borrow whatever you need. You may use your Contacts skill instead of your Resources skill to “buy” things. Everything “bought” this way has the aspect “Not Actually Mine”. The difficulty of an attempt to “buy” something with Contacts may or may not be the same as the difficulty of an attempt to buy that same thing with Resources, at the GM's discretion. The time required may also vary.  
**I'm Looking For Mr Brown:** You are extremely good at tracking people down. When trying to find someone with the Gathering Information trapping of the Contacts skill, add two to your Contacts skill and make the relevant rolls one time increment faster.  
**On The Watch:** (Requires Ear To The Ground) There’s something that you’re on the watch for, and you have a network of people who will tell you if it happens. Pick a topic roughly as broad as “Lawbreaking” or “My Little Pony”. The difficulty of any Getting The Tip-Off roll that you make related to that topic is reduced by four. (This doesn’t stack with Ear To The Ground).  
**Member:** You are a member of an organization. Add two to your Contacts skill when using it to contact other members of that organization. The situations in which this will be useful depend heavily on the organization.  
**Too Cool for School:** All the kids wanna be just like you. Add two to your Contacts skill when dealing with young adults between high school and middle school age.  
**Networking:** Networking is an important skill for a businessman, and you have it. Add two to your Contacts skill when using it in a corporate context.  
**Salesman's Network:** All good salesmen build up a network of satisfied customers over time. Pick a type of product. Add two to your Contacts skill when looking for or dealing with makers, sellers, or notable consumers of that type of product.  
**Network of Informants:** You know people who know things about the things that you want to know things about. Pick a subject roughly as broad as “the Red Court” or “academic politics”. Add two to your Contacts skill when using it to Gather Information or Get The Tip Off about that subject.  
**Discreet Investigations:** You are unusually subtle when it comes to gathering information. It isn't obvious when you use the Gathering Information trapping of the Contacts skill; people need to beat your Contacts roll with one of their own to notice it.  
  
# Conviction

**Sermonize:** Your speeches are more about passion than presentation. Add a new trapping called Preaching to your Conviction skill. The Preaching trapping is used to make social attacks, social maneuvers, and public speeches that are related to religious or moral issues.  
**Righteous:** You are nearly unstoppable when you’re doing what’s right. Add two to your Conviction skill when using it with your Righteousness power.*  
**Trust The Leader:** Your faith in your boss, be it the archangel Uriel or Colonel Carrington, is absolute. Pick a being. You may take two additional mild social or mental consequences against attempts to make you think or act against that being.  
**Fire And Brimstone:** Threatening someone's body isn't really your style. You prefer to threaten the soul. You may use your Conviction skill for the Threats trapping of the Intimidation skill when threatening someone with eternal damnation, divine hatred, or some similar fate.  
**Stubborn Faith:** You cling to your beliefs with amazing determination. You may take two additional minor consequences against attempts to make you act directly against the principles of your faith.  
**Shield Of Faith:** Your faith protects you from harm, repelling those evil beings that cannot tolerate its power. You may use your Conviction skill instead of your Athletics skill to defend against attacks from characters that have catches related to faith.  
**Religious Contacts:** You are well loved for your piety. You may use your Conviction skill instead of your Contacts skill when dealing with people who have centered their lives around the same religion as you. (This stunt may be excessively broad in some games. Please be cautious with it.)  
**Shield Of Dogma:** Words are meaningless against your fanatical will. You may use your Conviction skill for the social defense trapping of Rapport.  
**Threshold Guardian:** Your very presence is a shield against the forces of evil. Add three to your Conviction skill when using it in conjunction with the Bless This House power.*  
**Boosted Hexes:** You don’t get along with technology at all. Even compared to other wizards. All technology is treated as though it were two steps lower on the hexing table when determining how easily you can hex it.*  
**You Do Not Want To See My Soul:** Your soul has a truly profound effect on those who see it. Add two to your Conviction skill when using it to make mental attacks in a Soulgaze.*  
**Closer To God:** For whatever reason, God guides you just a little more carefully than is normal. Add two to your Conviction skill when using it with your Guide My Hand power.*  
**Lay On Hands:** Faith healing actually works. At least, it does for you. Use your Conviction skill instead of your Scholarship skill for medical treatment.  
**Sunday School:** Being religious means knowing about religion. Use your Conviction skill to determine your religious knowledge.  
**I KNOW I'm Right!:** Your knowledge of the righteousness of your beliefs gives you strength in trying times. You may use your Conviction skill for the Mental Defense trapping of the Discipline skill.  
**Set in My Ways:** You're old. It took you decades to form your beliefs and you're not about to abandon them. Add two to your Conviction skill when using it to resist attempts to change your deeply-held beliefs or your core identity.  
**My Magic Protects Me:** Your faith in your powers keep your foes at bay. Your Magic satisfies the catch for creatures vulnerable to tokens of faith or holy objects (unless they are only susceptible to a particular religion)  
  
# Craftsmanship

**Percussive Maintenance:** Sometimes a malfunctioning gadget just needs a good swift kick. You may spend a fate point to make any repair attempt in one exchange. Treat all such repairs as Jury-Rigged repairs.  
**Do You Like It? I Made It Myself:** A weapon you made yourself is a weapon that you know really well. When you wield weapons that you built yourself, your Craftsmanship skill complements whatever other skill you use to wield that weapon.  
**Personalized Weaponry Engineering:** Clever engineering can compensate for a lack of combat skill. When you take this stunt, pick a broad category of weapon. You may make weapons of this category with the special quality that you may wield them with your Craftsmanship skill. Such weapons will often include odd devices and unusual features that make their use very different from that of a normal weapon.  
**From Another Time:** You are intimately familiar with the technology of a time other than the present. Choose a time period other than the present day. Add two to your Craftsmanship skill when dealing with stuff from that time period.  
**Innovation Trumps Experience:** Teaching yourself sorcery with a background in engineering means not using the “traditional" Crafting methods. The strength ratings of the enchanted items that you create are based off of your Craftsmanship skill.*  
**Bunker Builder:** You know how to make effective fortifications. Given time, you may fortify a zone with your Craftsmanship skill. Your Craftsmanship roll than functions as a block against entry to that zone and ranged attacks into it. The time required to fortify a zone will vary according to GM discretion, as will the duration that fortification lasts for.  
**Bricoleur:** You are skilled at improvising when making, breaking, or repairing something. Add one to your Craftsmanship skill when making Declarations and Assessments in the art of Bricolage ("to make creative and resourceful use of whatever materials are at hand (regardless of their original purpose)").  
**Skilled Bricoleur:** (Requires Bricoleur) Your creativity at improvising is unparalleled. You may ignore up to two points of penalties to your Craftsmanship skill due to insufficient tools or materials.  
**Master Bricoleur:** (Requires Skilled Bricoleur) Your skill and resourcefulness are unparalleled. When you engage in the art of Bricolage, your creations are cobbled together one time increment faster than normal and last two time increments longer than they would otherwise.  
**Big Pocking Wrench:** You can do a lot as long as you have your trusty giant wrench on hand. Add two to your Craftsmanship skill when using it to fix or break something with a large wrench, as long as the wrench is actually useful for what you are using it for.  
**Scavenger:** There is an art to making things quickly out of cannibalized parts. You find it easy, because the people who made the thing you took apart did most of the work. If as part of a Craftsmanship roll made to build or fix something you take apart an object that contains parts appropriate to the thing you are building or fixing, you may make that Craftsmanship roll two time increments faster.  
**Sneaky Bastard:** You are an expert in the subtle art of booby-trapping an area. If given time to prepare a location, you may create traps in that location. When in an area that you have booby-trapped, you may make physical attacks with your Craftsmanship skill. The weapon ratings and ranges of these attacks depend upon the traps used to make them. The time required to set a trap and the time that they last for will vary based on GM discretion.  
**Locksmith:** If you can take apart a clock, you can take apart a lock. You may use your Craftsmanship skill for the Lockpicking trapping of the Burglary skill.  
  
# Deceit

**Feint:** When it looks like you're going to go right, you go left. And vice versa. Add two to your Deceit skill when using it for maneuvers to create Aspects that have to do with confusion and misdirection in physical combat.  
**Superior Feint:** (Requires Feint) They thought they had you, but they thought wrong. You may use your Deceit skill for the Dodging trapping of the Athletics skill against the physical attacks of characters who have aspects that you placed on them with a Deceit maneuver that benefited from the Feint stunt.  
**Data Manipulation:** It's easy to fool someone when you have graphs to back you up. In your hands, charts and graphs are weapon 2 for Deceit attacks. There must be some sort of connection between the chart or graph and the attack, but it need not be a solid one.  
**One Big Lie:** Tell a lie long enough and you begin to believe it. Pick a statement that isn't true. Add two to your Deceit skill when using it to convince someone that that statement is true. Reduce the bonus provided by this stunt to one when it applies to a social or mental attack.  
**Shield of Lies:** Your lies run so deep that you almost believe them yourself. You may use your Deceit skill instead of your Presence skill to determine the length of your social stress track.  
**Impenetrable Bluff:** You can bluff like a poker pro. Maybe you are a poker pro. Increase your Deceit skill by two when using it to trick people into believing that you are more capable or better positioned than you actually are.  
**It's Just Creative Lying:** Really, acting is just an advanced form of lying. You may your Deceit skill for the Playing To An Audience trapping of the Performance skill when acting.  
**The Appearance Of Wealth:** You seem like a wealthy and powerful person, regardless of the reality. You may use your Deceit skill for the Money Talks trapping of the Resources skill.  
**Wearing An Extremely Trustworthy Face:** It's hard to disbelieve what those closest to you tell you. While successfully impersonating someone, your Deceit attacks inflict two additional stress to that someone's close associates.  
**Founded Upon Lies:** You are very good at turning innocuous lies into devastating ones. Whenever you invoke or tag an aspect that you created with a Deceit maneuver to boost a Deceit roll, add one to your roll in addition to the normal benefits.  
**Defensive Lies:** You can come up with a counterpoint to any point, as long as you don’t worry about honesty. You may use your Deceit skill for the social defence trapping of the Rapport skill.  
**Houdini:** You could be found by the police standing next to a burned-down church with a handful of matches and a can of gasoline and still get away scot free. Add two to your Deceit skill when using it to defend against attempts to discern or prove your involvement in a crime.  
**Faustian Pact:** Your job is to trick people into signing unfair contracts. When you make a social attack with the Cat And Mouse trapping of the Deceit skill to convince someone to make a deal, you may treat a written copy of the deal as weapon 2 for that attack.  
**Illusion Of Grandeur:** Making a good first impression is all about misrepresenting yourself. You may use your Deceit skill for the First Impressions trapping of the Rapport skill.  
**"Honest" Lawyer:** Okay, maybe they don’t exist. But most people would say that you are one, anyway. Use your Deceit skill as a knowledge skill for legal matters in place of the Scholarship skill.  
**Master Manipulator:** You can treat other people like chess pieces and make it work. Add one to your Deceit skill when using it to make an attack designed to trick your target into following a preset plan of yours.

When you tag an aspect created through Fight By Jumping to boost a Weapons attack, that attack inflicts two additional stress.  
**Perfect Parry:** You are a master of not attacking anyone in a fight. Add two to your Weapons defence rolls when taking a full defence action. This stacks with the normal benefits provided by full defence.  
**Precision Strike:** You know where to hit, and how to make it count. When you successfully perform a maneuver with your Weapons skill, the resulting aspect is automatically sticky. In addition, the difficulty of any attempt to remove the resulting aspect is increased by two.  
**Master's Bladework:** Your swordsmanship is truly a thing of beauty. Add two to your Weapons skill when using it to perform a maneuver related to your sword work.  
**Follow-Through Cut:** You cut down lesser warriors the way a scythe cuts wheat. Whenever you take an enemy out with a melee attack using your Weapons skill, you may use your overflow shifts to create an additional attack with the same weapon against another enemy in the same zone. (A similar stunt could exist in Fists.)  
**O-Chiburi:** When you get blood on your blade, you flick it off with a very intimidating-looking technique. When you inflict stress with an attack using the Weapons skill, you may sacrifice your next action to turn your attack roll into an automatically-successful maneuver related to fear or awe or looking really badass. (A similar stunt could exist in Fists or Guns.)  
**Blade-Breaking Force:** You hit so hard that your weapons break. When you attack with the Weapons skill you may choose to add three to your attack's weapon rating. If you do so, and your attack hits, the weapon that the attack was made with is destroyed.  
**Defender:** You watch over not only yourself but others. Allies in your zone may take a supplemental action to hide behind you. If you take a supplemental action to protect your allies, they may use your Weapons skill to defend against melee attacks that exchange. You may take a single supplemental action each exchange to protect up to two allies. Both you and your allies may take these supplemental actions in response to an incoming attack, as long as you have not yet acted during that exchange.  
**The Wardens Way:** You have trained many months and fought many battles with your blade. Gain a +2 to your weapons skill when using your Wardens Sword.  
**Awkward in my** **Hand:** (reverse stunt, _gives you back_ one refresh) You're not that great with using unfamiliar weapons. Take a -2 penalty to your Weapons skill when using a kind of weapon you haven't already declared you are trained with (If you generally fight with your sword, you're not going to be that great with a chain mace).

Questionable ones from <https://web.archive.org/web/20180722134733/https://dfrpg-resources.wikispaces.com/Questionable%20Stunts>

# Athletics

**Magic Dodge:** You only need to will a spell not to affect you if it can hit you in the first place. Use Athletics instead of Discipline to dodge any magical attack whose physical trappings mean getting out of the way is a valid option.

# Discipline

**I've Seen It All:** You've seen and done things that would make most beings cringe, and have become practiced at ignoring such stress. You may use Discipline in place of Conviction to determine your mental stress track.  
  
# Lore

**Lore is My Strength:** Your vast knowledge of magic and its effects enable you to get much stronger results than normal from your spellcrafting. Use Lore in place of Conviction for spellcasting. Should not be taken with **Lore is My Guide.**

# Rapport

**Good First Impression:** You gain +2 to your first rapport roll when meeting someone.
