# Corruption

You are...unfortunate. Whatever turned on your superpowers did not do so nicely, and you've been rendered an almost-inhuman mess.

## Basic Corruption

Your powers have a particularly disturbing aesthetic. You might be obviously mutated or disfigured, you might look like a corpse or a monster, or you might simply seem "wrong" to everyone around you on a subtle, psychological level. Regardless of the specifics, your presence is unnerving.

## Enhancements

Horrifying to Behold Something about your appearance is so
unsettling that it actually hurts people to get close to you. Anyone who
attacks you using [[Fight]] takes a mild mental consequence if they don't
already have one.

### Ongoing Mutations
Once per scene, you can spend a [[fate point]] to undergo a dramatic sudden mutation. This lets you to switch the ranks of any two skills of adjacent rank.

### Obvious Target 
You don't need to work hard to get someone to want you dead. You gain +2 to [[Provoke]] when attempting to make a target attack or follow you.

## Common Power Synergies

### Elasticity 
It works like elasticity, but actually what you have are eldritch tentacles sprouting from your back, dribbling ichor on the floor.

### Harm 
The corruption in you can spread to others with a little physical contact.

### Regeneration 
You're basically falling apart already---your power just makes you good at pulling yourself together.

## Drawbacks

- No explanation needed for this one: [Visibly Corrupted].
- Your power kicked in when you were irradiated in an accident that should have been fatal. Instead, you survived, but your body is twisted and [Radioactive].

## Collateral Damage Effects

## Decay
You can use your corruption to accelerate the natural decay of virtually everything in your zone. Living targets have some resistance and only take 2 physical stress, while inanimate targets are more adversely affected---virtually everything, including the walls and the floor, withers to dust.
