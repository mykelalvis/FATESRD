# Energy Blast

A classic power with innumerable variations: you can shoot stuff. Lasers from your eyes, fire from your fists, things like that.

**Basic Energy Blast:** You can fire a projectile of some sort, with a range of three zones, using [[Shoot]].

### Enhancements

**Master Energy Blast:** Your shots are especially accurate. Gain +2 to [[Shoot]] when using your power.

**Long-Range Blaster:** Your projectile is tightly focused; you can fire up to 6 zones away.

**Defensive Blasts:** You throw out energy blasts quickly and accurately enough to intercept other projectiles. You can defend using [[Shoot]] against attacks from another zone that you are aware of.

**Kinetic Acceleration:** Anything that you can physically lift, from a playing card to a person, you can toss with all the power of an energy blast. This is an attack using [[Shoot]]. If your projectile could be harmed, it defends against your attack as well.

### Common Power Synergies

**Projection:** What you fire isn't just a blast of undifferentiated energy; it's a specific element. Pick from Fire Projection, Electricity Projection, Frost Projection, or Shadow Projection.

**Item Summoning:** You aren't throwing pure energy; you're just throwing stuff that you pull out of thin air.

**Flight:** Basic physics. Point your energy blasts down, and you go up!

### Drawbacks

- Your energy blast takes the form of lasers shooting from your eyes. This is great for sniping at a distance, but not for tracking nearby targets. You are [Inaccurate at Close Range].
- Your blasts come with huge bursts of concussive force, which generate [Lots of Collateral Damage].
- You don't have true control over your blasts: energy pours out of you non-stop, but you have safety equipment to hold it in check until you need to fire. [You Need a Mask to Protect Those Around You].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Rapid Fire:** You can shoot every target within your zone at full strength. If you throw out that many shots, though, you can't help but hit something you don't mean to.

**Charged Shot:** If you take a few seconds to concentrate, you can generate a blast with enough force to blow open the door to a bank vault, destroy a reinforced wall, or otherwise eradicate an obstacle. Of course, a blast this big is slow and imprecise. It'll tear up the entire room.
