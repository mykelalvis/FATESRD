# Electricity Projection

You are filled with enough electrical potential to make Tesla blush.

**Basic Electricity Projection:** Your powers are electrical in nature, and you're infused with electrical energy. Whenever you use your power, you create sparks and bolts of lightning.

### Enhancements

**Power Generation:** You can power any electrical device just by holding it. If you put your fingers to an electrical outlet, you can provide power for an entire apartment.

**Conductive Trip:** You can briefly convert your entire body into electricity and push through conductive material. You can use this power to pass through an otherwise impenetrable barrier, such as a door with a metal doorknob, as an action.

**Stunning Blow:** When you succeed with style on a melee attack, give your target the [[situation aspect]] [Stunned] with one free invocation. If they are already [Stunned], add another free invocation to the aspect.

### Common Power Synergies

**Energy Blast:** You can pull a lightning bolt out of nowhere and hurl it like a spear.

**Machine Control:** The power you create isn't just normal electricity; it's got a bit of your essence in it. It's starting a machine with your own energy that puts it under your control.

### Drawbacks

- As a walking, talking nexus of electrical activity, you find that [Modern Tech Just Doesn't Like You].
- You are filled with electrical energy, just all the time. It's like being hopped up on sugar and caffeine, only more so! You are [Hyperactive].
- People notice that you tend to keep your superheroics indoors on rainy days. It's not your fault: [Water Shorts You Out].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Through the Grid:** You can leap into any electrical outlet in the city and emerge a moment later from another one, provided you have a general idea where it is and you are willing to short out and overload electronics at your destination.
