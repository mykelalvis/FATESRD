# Super Agility

You are an acrobat without compare, a position you show off best with your graceful leaps.

**Basic Super Agility:** You are preternaturally graceful, and gain +2 to [[Athletics]] when leaping, balancing, or otherwise demonstrating your agility. In addition, you have a prodigious leap: leaping up to a second-story window or from rooftop to rooftop across a wide alleyway is a simple task that, without further complication, requires no [[Athletics]] roll.

### Enhancements

**Master Super Agility:** You gain an additional +2 bonus to [[Athletics]] when demonstrating your superior agility.

**Cat's Landing:** You know just how to land after even the highest fall. When you fall, you land on your feet and take no damage, regardless of the height you fall from, as long as you are conscious.

**Uncanny Dodge:** If you can see a projectile coming, you can get out of its way with some clever gymnastics. You gain +2 to defense rolls when dodging ranged attacks.

### Common Power Synergies

**Super Strength:** They tell you to lift with your legs, and you have strong legs indeed.

**Flight:** You might not have true flight, but your leaps are so superhumanly good that they are nearly indistinguishable from flying.

### Drawbacks

- Your legs are perpetually coiled springs, and they don't like being still. When you aren't leaping through the air, you are [Restless].
- While your leaps are decent enough, what actually moves you are lines of sticky webbing that work like grappling hooks. You [Need Solid Anchor Points] in order to move. Your leaps are amazing, but not incredibly accurate. Outside that's not a problem, but you are [Accident-Prone While Indoors].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Mighty Bound:** If you put everything you have into it, you can leap incredible distances, from the ground to basically any outdoor point in the city. Of course, putting that much muscle into a jump will crack the pavement, both where you jump from and where you land.

**Hair-Trigger Reaction:** If you are targeted by a ranged attack from another zone, you can use your superhuman agility to not just leap out of the way, but also leap toward your attacker, landing in their zone. This causes the attack to miss you, but it will still hit something in your zone.
