# Disguise

Your ability to disguise yourself as another person is uncanny. Who are you, really?

**Basic Disguise:** You can alter your face, build, and voice at will in order to become a completely different person. Once you spend time interacting with someone, you can imitate them near-perfectly. Gain a +2 bonus to Deception to oppose others trying to see through your disguise.

### Enhancements

**Master Disguise:** Your mimicry is more convincing than ever. Gain an additional +2 bonus to Deception to resist being recognized.

**Sartorial Doubling:** Your ability to copy a person extends beyond their body. You can also change the clothes you are wearing, and even imitate guns or other props---although they are, of course, non-functional.

**Close Observation:** You can mimic a target without getting close; you only need to spend a few minutes observing them at a distance. You can even double a target you've only seen on video.

### Common Power Synergies

[[Shape-shifting]]: Altering your face and body is good practice for your fine detail work, but you can change your entire shape when you need to.

[[Illusion]] You aren't actually altering your face; you're just projecting a disguise over it, using your mastery of illusions.

### Drawbacks

- There's a reason you spend most or all of your time wearing someone else's face: your own is an [Inhuman Visage].
- Too much time spent being someone else. Too many faces, too many lives. You've reached the point where you [Don't Know Who You Are Anymore].
- You can't consciously control the way your face changes. Instead, your power is [Touch-Activated]; it only triggers when you physically touch your target.

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Killing Disguise:** You might take a target's identity completely---not just appearance and voice, but also their mannerisms and memories, perfectly duplicated. Anyone attempting to see through your disguise faces Legendary (+8) opposition. This is an invasive procedure, and you need to physically poke around in your target's brain. You can use this effect to take out and then imitate a nameless NPC, but to imitate a named NPC or PC, you will need to kill them or otherwise access their fresh corpse.

**Demonic Gaze:** While you're generally limited to a human disguise, you have a face in your repertoire that's grotesque and terrifying, which you can pull out when you need to scare a crowd. Everyone who can see you must defend using [[Will]] against Great (+4) opposition or get a mild mental consequence.
