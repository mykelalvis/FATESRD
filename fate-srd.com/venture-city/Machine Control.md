# Machine Control

You have a powerful psychic bond with machines of all sorts. They do what you tell them to. You don't even need a manual.

**Basic Machine Control:** You can control machines up to one zone away without touching them. Most machines won't resist you at all, but something computerized will put up Fair (+2) opposition, and more complex and powerful computers will offer greater opposition; you use [[Empathy]] to overcome this opposition. You can only make a machine do something it's capable of; while you couldn't make a toaster float, for instance, you could make a car drive itself.

### Enhancements

**Master Machine Control:** You gain +2 to [[Empathy]] when telling machines what to do.

**Machine Language:** You can communicate with machines psychically, although their intelligence is limited by their capabilities. For example, a toaster couldn't tell you who all has passed through the room, but it could tell you if someone has made toast recently. 

**Built-in Wi-Fi:** Your brain is able to pick up signals of all sorts. You have a permanently active Internet connection, and you can hear both sides of nearby cell phone conversations.

**Alarm Bypass:** Technology has so great an affinity for you that security measures---from alarm systems to landmines---simply do not go off for you. They will, however, go off for anyone traveling with you. 

### Common Power Synergies

**Gadgeteering:** Because machines listen to you, and you to them, you can create and repair devices much better than anyone else.

### Drawbacks

- Because you have a bond with machinery, it has a bond with you. In a technologically advanced city, that means [The Machines Never Stop Talking!]
- Your ability to control machinery is psychic in nature and tied into your emotional state. This can cause [Unwanted Feedback]. You might be able to sense machinery near you, and control it when it's away from you, but the only way to access a psychic link is by physically touching the machine you want to influence. Your power [Requires Physical Contact].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Escape Plan:** Wherever you are, whatever the situation, you can summon a vehicle, such as a car or helicopter, to take you and your allies to safety. Generally speaking, this vehicle will arrive by crashing through a wall or the ceiling.

**Overload:** You can make any electronic device overcharge itself to the point where it violently explodes. This counts as a Fantastic (+6) attack against everyone in the same zone as the exploding device.
