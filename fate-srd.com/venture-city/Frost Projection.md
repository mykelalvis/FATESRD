# Frost Projection

You bring winter wherever you go.

**Basic Frost Projection:** Your power expresses itself through ice and cold. Whenever you use your power, the temperature of the room drops.

### Enhancements

**Temperature Reduction:** You can create freezer-cold temperatures at will, rendering your zone or an adjacent zone uncomfortably chilly.

**Ice Slick:** As an action, you can create a patch of ice that fills your zone or an adjacent zone. You can move through the ice easily, but to friends and foes it is a Fair (+2) obstacle. The slick lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

**Icy Aura:** Whenever someone successfully attacks you using [[Fight]], they take 1 physical stress from the sheer cold.

### Common Power Synergies

**Energy Blast:** You can fire off a concentrated blast of sub-Arctic temperature.

**Slowing:** You can encase your opponents in ice, stopping them in their tracks.

**Natural Weapon:** You can freeze the moisture in the air around your fists, forming a painful set of ice knuckles.

### Improved Special Effects

**Ice Shield:** You can encase yourself in a thin shell of ice, giving you Armor:4 against the next attack you suffer, at which point the bonus ends. Moving or taking a physical action breaks the shell, ending this bonus.

### Drawbacks

- Weather that others would consider merely chilly is, to you, sweltering. You can [Only Live in the Cold].
- You aren't just cold to the touch; you bring the temperature down all around you, whether you like it or not. You don't mind it, but
  you are [Always Freezing].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Blizzard:** You can dial down the temperature so quickly that snow forms in your zone and every adjacent zone. You can move through the snow without a problem, but to everyone else it's a Fair (+2) obstacle that persists until the end of the scene.
