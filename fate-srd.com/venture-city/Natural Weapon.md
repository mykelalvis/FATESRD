Venture City

# Natural Weapon

You come pre-armed for everyone's inconvenience.

**Basic Natural Weapon:** You have some sort of built-in weaponry, whether it be claws or crackling energy that surrounds your fists. You gain +2 to [[Fight]] while brawling unarmed in close quarters.

### Enhancements

**Master Natural Weapon:** Your weapon is deadlier than most. Gain an additional +2 bonus to [[Fight]] when unarmed in close combat.

**Critical Hit:** Whenever you cause stress using your natural weapon, you may instead cause a mild consequence, if the target doesn't already have one.

**Bloody Weapon:** When you attack with your natural weapon and succeed with style, give the defender the [[situation aspect]] [Bleeding] with one [[free invocation]]. If they are already [Bleeding], add another [[free invocation]] to the aspect.

### Common Power Synergies

**Energy Blast:** Your natural weapon is just the close-up version of a power blast, encasing your fists with energy rather than tossing it at distant foes.

**Super Agility:** Your favorite opening maneuver is leaping at your prey from a distance, claws first.

### Drawbacks

- You don't know which came first, the retractile claws or the animal sensibilities, but you can't have one without the other. While you're armed with a natural weapon, you are also [Half-Feral].
- Your weapon isn't as simple as jutting bone spurs; your fists generate a strange energy that you can't entirely shut off. It makes you dangerous to foes, but you're also [A Danger to Anyone Nearby].
- Your natural weapon isn't attached to your hands, but to your elbows or knees. It's no less effective, but you're [Only Good Up
  Close].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Eviscerate:** If you are unconcerned with the damage you cause to the city, let alone the psyches of those around you, you can dive weapons-first into action. You can instantly take out a nameless NPC, or cause a mild consequence to a named NPC or PC.

**Berserk:** Of course someone with knives jutting from their fists has a berserk mode! If you fall into an incomprehensible rage, you become an especially deadly combatant, gaining Armor:2 and +1 to all attacks. Because you are in a berserk rage, though, you can't stop yourself from causing collateral damage. This rage lasts until the end of the scene or you choose to end it.
