Venture City

# Super Strength

You are a powerhouse, a wall of muscle, an unstoppable force. Are you strong? Listen, bud...you really are.

**Basic Super Strength:** You gain +2 to [[Physique]] in all situations that require pure strength.

### Enhancements

**Master Super Strength:** There's strong, and then there's you. Gain an additional +2 bonus to [[Physique]] in situations requiring pure strength.

**Stand Fast:** You aren't going to get pushed around so easily. You are immune to all forced movement.

### Common Power Synergies

**Natural Weapon:** Who needs weapons when you can put this much muscle behind every hit?

**Super Toughness:** Tough and strong, strong and tough. A natural fit. 

### Improved Special Effect

**Hammer Toss:** You can move a target of your attack up to four zones away.

### Drawbacks

- Your super strength also makes you super aggressive. Sometimes you can't help but fly into a [Destructive Rage].
- Your power isn't as supernormal as some others; it comes from having muscles on muscles on muscles. You are big and beefy but, unfortunately, [Clumsy].
- Super strength isn't quite the gift everyone makes it out to be; just ask the trail of broken doors, shattered plates, and other chaos you leave in your wake. It's not fun when you [Don't Know Your Own Strength].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**POW!:** It's pretty trivial for you to just pick someone up and toss 'em through the scenery. You can take out a nameless NPC entirely, or deal a mild consequence to anyone else, at the expense of the structural integrity of the buildings around you.

**SMASH!:** You can raise your mighty fists and hit the ground with enough force that the whole earth seems to shake, attacking everyone in your zone with [[Physique]].
