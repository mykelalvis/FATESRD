# Material Mimic

You are what you touch.

**Basic Material Mimicry:** While in contact with any material---iron, stone, wood, and so on---you can alter your body to mimic that substance, turning into a living statue. To do so, [[Create Advantage]] using [[Physique]] against Fair (+2) opposition. If you succeed, you gain an aspect reflecting your new state, such as [Body of Steel]. You may only have one such aspect at once, and it goes away if you break contact with the substance you're mimicking.

### Enhancements

**Master Mimicry:** You are skilled at converting your body into esoteric stuff. You gain +2 to [[Physique]] when using your power.

**Multiple Mimicry:** If you concentrate, you can mimic multiple forms of matter at once, becoming, for instance, a wood-and-iron hybrid. You may have two Material Mimicry aspects at once.

**Mimicry Memory:** When you break contact with the substance you're mimicking, you do not lose your Material Mimicry aspect. Instead, the aspect lasts until the end of the scene or until you begin mimicking a new substance.

### Common Power Synergies

**Super Toughness:** You can be literally made of iron at a moment's notice; of course you're hard to hurt.

**Natural Weapon:** When you change form, you can sharpen your hands into impressive blades or form them into a mighty warhammer.

**Invisibility:** Your ability to mimic the color and design of materials makes you a natural chameleon.

### Drawbacks

- You can't turn into just anything you want; your power is [Limited to Organic Materials].
- You often trigger your power without meaning to. You suffer from [Involuntary Mimicry].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Bulking Up:** If you're mimicking something sufficiently massive, like a brick wall or the asphalt in the street, you can actually absorb the material. You become huge, up to eight feet tall, and gain +2 to [[Physique]] while you mimic that substance. This transformation lasts a few minutes before the extra mass begins to leech out, and the absorption does a lot of damage to whatever you stole the mass from.

**Untouchably Airy:** If an attack would hit you, you can take on a body of air, allowing it to pass right through you. You take no stress and can move up to two zones away before you resolidify. The attack, however, still goes somewhere and causes collateral damage.
