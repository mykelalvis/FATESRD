## Character Creation

Begin the game by naming your character, applying scores to your
attributes, developing a high concept, and defining a trouble for your
PC. Fill out remaining aspects and add stunts during the game to develop
your own story as the game progresses.

Apply scores (+3, +2, +2, +1, +1, 0) to Attributes (Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) in any order.

Develop a high concept such as "Brash Dwarven Fighter" or "Erudite
Elf Wizard".

**Example Adjectives**: 1 brash, 2 curious, 3 erudite, 4 quiet, 5
violent, 6 charming, 7 scarred, 8 generous, 9 proud, 10 uncivilized, 11
friendly, 12 noble, 13 chivalrous, 14 relaxed, 15 stern, 16 cold, 17
loud, 18 lone, 19 inquisitive, 20 cheery.

**Example Races**: Human, Dwarf, Elf, or Halfling.

**Example Classes**: Cleric, fighter, mage, thief, ranger, sorcerer, or
paladin.

haunted 14 sloth 15 pessimistic 16 undisciplined 17 cowardly 18 vengeful
19 curious 20 mischievous.

As the game progresses, choose three additional aspects such as
relationships, backgrounds, or unique items.

**Example Relationships**: 1 sibling 2 protector 3 apprentice 4 captor 5
childhood friend 6 fellow prisoner 7 fellow slave 8 acolyte 9 employee
10 charmed victim 11 sworn enemy 12 guardsmen 13 business associates 14

of the planes 12 forbidden tome 13 living longbow 14 obsidian dagger 15
dragon fang 16 sword of kings 17 singing pearl 18 hammer of thunderbolts
19 flametongue sword 20 staff of the magi

## Example Stunts

Choose up to three stunts as the game progresses or build your own
custom stunts using these as a model.

**Adventurer's Luck**: Begin each session with one extra [[Fate Point]].

**Backstab**: +2 to Attack an opponent currently fighting an ally in
melee while you wield a light blade.

**Bag of Holding**: Short of unique or magical items, you always have
the right tool for the right job.

given you a consequence.

obstacles.

**Cleave**: When fighting with a heavy blade, apply the results of an

consequence from a single ally.

**Empowered Spell**: +2 to Attack, Defend, Overcome, or Create an
Advantage when using a particular spell against a single monster or
horde.

**First Strike**: +2 to Attack an enemy that has not yet acted this
scene.

**Guardian**: Once per scene, you can take on stress that would normally
be applied to a nearby ally.

**Hail of Arrows**: Once per scene, when firing a bow, you can either
apply an Attack to three targets you can see or you can gain +3 when

with style (3 or more) when Defending, you can inflict 2 stress to your
attacker rather than take a boost.

Attacks inflict two additional stress.

**Whirlwind Attack**: Once per scene, when wielding two weapons, apply
the results of an Attack to three opponents or gain +3 when attacking a

## Magic

Spell casting works like any other action. Describe the spell, choose
intelligence or wisdom and the appropriate action: Overcome, Create an
Advantage, Attack, or Defend.

**Example Mage Spells**: detect magic, light, ray of frost, ghost sound,
mage hand, alarm, shield, fog, charm person, sleep, burning hands, magic
missile, acid arrow, darkness, scorching ray, invisibility, levitate,
dispel magic, explosive runes, fireball, lightning bolt, magic weapon,
wall of fire.

**Example Cleric Spells**: create water, cure wounds, detect magic,
inflict wounds, light, purify, resist fire, bless, divine favor, circle
of protection, sanctuary, shield of faith, consecrate, hold person,
spiritual weapon, create food and water, daylight, locate object, remove
curse, remove disease, searing light, speak with dead, restoration.

## Items

Players select what items their PCs possess within reason. High
dexterity represents light armor and weapons. High strength represents
heavy weapon use. High constitution determines heavy armor use.
Particularly powerful items work well as character aspects.

## Game Master Guide

Only players roll dice. GMs determine a challenge level (1 to 8) for
challenges including traps, hazards, secrets, and monsters. Players roll
against those challenge levels to attack, defend, overcome, or create
advantages.

A monster's level determines its attack, defense, number of stress
boxes, and size of stress boxes. A level 4 monster attacks at 4, defends
at 4, and has 4 stress boxes of 1, 2, 3, and 4 points each.

Level 3 monsters are roughly equivalent of PCs. Monster levels 1 and 2
are significantly weaker than PCs. Monster levels 4 and 5 are
significant threats. Monsters of level 6 and above may be deadly to PCs.
Beware!

Monsters can group up into "hordes" that act like a single monster at
a single level. For example, a large group of zombies might be a level 3
zombie horde. Stunts may specifically target hordes or single foes.

In each scene, the GM receives 1 [[Fate Point]] per PC in combat encounters
usable by monsters. [[Fate Point]]s can give level 4+ monsters extra
actions.

Creating an Advantage almost always has a challenge level of 2.
Advantages generally don't last more than the scene in which they are
created. PCs generally cannot maintain more than one Advantage in a
scene.

Magic items have Aspects with two free invocations that PCs can carry
from scene to scene. Powerful magic items may also have stunts. Example:
"Orcslayer Axe", two free invocations, +2 to Attack orcs.

Turn order starts with the PC with the highest dexterity furthest away
from the GM.

**GM Guidelines**

- Reveal all challenge levels to players.
- Spend GM [[Fate Point]]s in the open to spice up monsters.
- Build the game from what the players give you.

## Dungeons of Fate Design Concepts

[Dungeons of
Fate](http://s3.amazonaws.com/slyflourish_content/dungeons_of_fate.pdf)
is a [Fate Accelerated](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fae/) rules superset
intended for D&D-style dungeon delving adventures. It's intended for
single-session or short-run campaigns with either a [classic D&D
adventure](http://www.dndclassics.com/?affiliate_id=70406) or some
off-the-cuff dungeon explorations. It's designed heavily around the
concepts of the [Lazy Dungeon Master](https://slyflourish.com/lazydm/).

The PDF of Dungeons of Fate is only four pages. It's intended to be
printed double-sided with the character sheet and player rules on one
sheet and the GM worksheet and GM rules on the other. It expects that
GMs are familiar with [Fate
Core](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/) and [Fate
Accelerated](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fae/) though players can be new
to RPGs and still have a good time. If you aren't experienced with
Fate, you'll want to spend some time with the [[Fate Core]] System
Reference](https://fate-core/index.html) or [Fate Accelerated System
Reference](https://fate-accelerated/index.html).

## Five Minute Guided Character Creation

Dungeons of Fate focuses Fate's open-ended elements towards typical D&D
ideas to help new players get into the game quickly. Instead of
open-ended aspects, Dungeons of Fate suggests typical D&D races and
classes for a High Concept along with a character-defining adjective
like "angry" or "erudite". It also has suggestions for the trouble,
[Fiasco-style
relationships](https://slyflourish.com/fiasco_relationships.html), and
treasured items based on Rob Donoghue's idea of an "[aspect
anchor](http://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2013/10/11/anchors/)".

Instead of Fate Accelerated's six approaches, Dungeons of Fate uses the
standard D&D attributes. These compare easily to the six approaches but
still bring more of a D&D flavor into the system.

The four action types, invocations, compels, [[Fate Point]]s, stress, and
conditions are all pulled directly from Fate Accelerated.

Stunts can be hard for new players to come up with on their own so the
character creation guidelines includes a bunch of prebuilt stunts, many
of which can be customized for a particular character.

## Challenges and Monster Design

Challenges and monsters are simplified in Dungeons of Fate. Instead of
building monsters as characters with aspects and stunts, Dungeons of
Fate takes a lesson from Monte Cook's
[Numenera](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/114133/Numenera?affiliate_id=70406).
All challenges have a level between 1 and 8. The level determines the
target number a player must roll against on any action.

All monsters simply have a name and a level equal to the challenge level
of the monster. You don't have to write out any stats. You simply say
"level 4 ogre" or "level 2 rat horde" or "level 5 pit fiend". The
name acts as the monster's aspect and tells you everything you need to
know to run the monster at the table. It also means its very easy to
convert monsters from other systems. The term "horde" also has a
specific meaning in Dungeons of Fate, defining a horde of monsters all
piled in a single stat block. This term also triggers off of certain
stunts like "cleave" to give the feeling of hacking down multiple
enemies in a single swing.

The level of a monster determines the number of stress boxes a monster
has. A level 5 monster, for example, has five stress boxes able to
absorb 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 stress respectively. When a PC tries to attack
this monster, it must beat a 5. When that monster attacks, the PC must
defend against an attack of 5. GMs can use [[Fate Point]]s to increase the
level by 2 for an action but generally, they're going against the exact
level of the monster.

Complicated traps or even delicate social situations can have the same
level system. A heated debate with a king might have a level of 4 with
four stress boxes and a default score of 4 for the purposes of
overcoming, attacking, or defending. A powerful rune-encrusted fire
pillar trap might have a level of 3, with three stress boxes and a
default of 3 for attacks, defenses, and [[overcome]] actions. This
level-based challenge system is similar to the D&D 4e skill challenge
system but are much easier to run.

Levels have a steep difficulty curve. Anything over a 3 is going to be
tougher than a standard PC and level 6, 7, and 8 are going to be near
impossible to beat. Level 8 is reserved for demi-gods, elder evils, and
great old ones.

A level 3 monster is the typical equivalent of a PC. A level 4 monster
is roughly equivalent to two PCs. A level 5 monster is a good single
challenge for four or five PCs. A level 6 monster will be very hard for
a group to defeat.

## Magic and Creating Advantages

Magic in Dungeons of Fate is handled like any other action. The player
describes the spell and the GM determines the difficulty. This means
there's no reason a wizard PC cannot call down a meteor swarm or cast
"power word kill" if they want, but it's still an Intelligence roll
versus the level of the monsters. Many spells use the Create an
Advantage action.

Creating an Advantage generally has a challenge level of 2. This
prevents players from being punished for not Creating the right sort of
Action to reach a challenge level of 2. Advantages created in this
manner generally do not persist from scene to scene and a PC can
generally only maintain one advantage at a time. This prevents players
from stacking up dozens of advantages and trucking them around between
scenes.

## Designed for the Lazy Dungeon Master

The GM never rolls the dice in Dungeons of Fate. Players always roll to
Attack, Defend, Overcome, or [[create advantage]] against the level of
the challenge whether that challenge is a monster, a trap, or a
situation.

The GM guidelines of Dungeons of Fate includes a GM worksheet and a
bunch of random tables to make it easy for the GM to build improvised
dungeons, quests, monsters, and NPCs. It's designed around the core
ideas of the [Lazy Dungeon Master](https://slyflourish.com/lazydm/).

[Dungeons of
Fate](http://s3.amazonaws.com/slyflourish_content/dungeons_of_fate.pdf)
is intended to make it easy to run a quick and fun D&D game that feels
like the classic D&D we remember of old. Printed two-sided, the GM rules
and GM worksheet take up only a single page. Every character sheet can
have full character creation guidelines printed on the back. It's
designed to be a perfect companion for your [GM Walk Away
Kit](https://slyflourish.com/dm_walk_away_kit.html).
