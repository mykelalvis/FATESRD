# The Edge Die

Imagine a white room. A perfect arena of objective judgment, where the
best will rise to the top and the losers will be weeded out. Now throw
that idea away because it'll never happen. The Edge Die acknowledges
that in the real world, circumstances change constantly, and every
single variable can [[shift]] the dynamics of power significantly.

The Edge die tracks the flow of power from side to side, tracking who
currently has fortune on their side.

There are three basic ways to get the edge:

- **Start with it, through overwhelming odds being stacked in your
  favor.** All things the same, monsters always start with the edge.
- **Gain it through an overcome action.** This is always actively
  opposed.
- **Seize it by overwhelming defense.** Any time you defend against
  someone who has the edge and you succeed with style, you can take
  the edge from them.

## No Starting Edge?

At the beginning of an encounter, the GM decides where the Edge starts
out. The default state is technically that nobody has the edge. But
that's very rare. That's addressed under "Start With It" below. The GM
has to determine sides, and weigh the scenario. But sometimes, just
sometimes, nobody has the edge to start. This doesn't necessarily mean
that everyone's on perfect, exact, equal white room footing. It does
mean a couple of things, though:

- Neither side has a significant advantage, or both sides have
  significant advantages.
- There aren't any inherent, easily exploitable advantages in play.

If those two things are true, the GM can choose to start a scene with
neither side having the edge. In those cases, an overcome action or a
defend action succeeded with style will decide the first side with the
edge.

Now the other case for not starting with the edge in play is if there's
no active opposition. If nothing's actually trying to stop the players
from getting what they want, then there's not really a need for the
edge. But, if that's the case, why even bother rolling? Or,
alternatively, figure out what is actually trying to stop them.

## Start with It

Most of the time, one side in a scene starts with the edge. The GM
determines this by a few basic criteria:

- All things equal, the side with a significant advantage get the
  edge.
- If both sides have monsters, give it to the side with the more
  powerful monster.
- If the characters have established situational aspects to use
  against their opposition, then they start with the edge.

## Overcome Action

Characters can seize the edge with a dedicated overcome action. This is
usually just a normal overcome action with an active opposition from the
person with the edge. In practice, this means it's often very difficult
to seize the edge from stronger opposition, and usually requires
invoking aspects to do. Even when it works out, succeeding with style is
exceedingly rare.

Opponents can seize the edge back this way, rolling against the
player's defend roll.

## Overwhelming Defense

Any time someone with the edge is coming at you and you have a valid
defend action available, you have a chance of seizing the edge. If you
successfully defend with style, the edge switches hands.

Note that this is always valid---the opponent doesn't have to actually
be using the edge die on the action you're defending from. Otherwise,
defending with style would be almost impossible. Also, if you choose to
seize the edge, you don't get the normal boost from succeeding with
style. You already get the edge die. That's a good enough bonus.

## The Edge Die

When you use the edge, you get to replace one of the four fate dice in
your dice roll with the edge die. The edge die is a single, regular
six-sided die.

So, instead of the normal fate die result of [+],
[-], or [0], you get a result of 1 to 6. So
while the normal roll results in a -4 to +4 result, with the edge die,
it's -2 to +9. The edge die is valid on any action you wish, be it an
overcome, create an advantage, attack, or defend action. You can use it
with stunts as well, unless the stunt says otherwise.

## One Free Use

The edge can't just be used over and over freely---it's an immensely
powerful mechanic. Every time your side gets the edge, you get one free
use of it. In some scenes, the edge will [[shift]] from one side to the
other and back again a few times; each time the new 'owner' gets a free
use. However, if the opponent didn't actually get to use the edge die,
and you take it, you don't get a free use. You can't just lock the
opponent in a loop of gaining the edge and taking it back from them
before they get a chance to use it for effectively infinite edge dice.

After the free use, additional uses of the edge cost [[fate point]]s.

## Sides

An individual doesn't have an edge---a "side" does. The free use of the
edge each time a side gets it has to be shared; one person gets to use
it, the others have to spend [[fate point]]s. If this is ever up for debate,
the person who seized the edge should take precedence. They can either
take the free edge die, or choose who gets it.

## Sharing is Caring

One thing we like to do is use a single, dedicated edge die instead of
having every player keep their own. When someone seizes the edge, they
literally take the edge die from whomever had it.

This serves double duty at the table.

First off, it helps to keep track of where the edge is at any given
time. If you get in the practice of handing the edge die around whenever
it switches hands in the narrative, you'll never forget where it was,
because it's wherever it physically is. This is especially nice for
scenes where someone needs to step aside for a quick break, a phone
call, whatever.

It also helps to remind the players of the camaraderie in play in the
story. If one player just recently took the edge, and another's taking
an important action, the first player can physically hold it up,
offering it for use. This is like a physical representation of "handing
off the baton" and letting one character's effort bolster another's.
Sure, the rules don't change at all, but it feels better.

## Multiple Sides in a Scene

Okay so we know how the edge switches hands from one side to another and
back again. What if there's are tons of different sides, all working in
their own interests?

Basically it works exactly the same. Every "side" counts as its own
separate entity, and can possess the edge. Any given side of a conflict
can take the edge through the same methods, and each side has access to
a free use of the edge die every time they get it.

The only real guideline here is that it's best to simplify groups where
possible. If there are two groups that are working toward the same goal
despite not being inherently affiliated, they're still one side for the
conflict. Most often, this means two groups of monsters going after the
player team. But if the players split them up and turn it into a
three-way struggle, then they're separate sides.

This doesn't make things inherently easier for the players, but it means
the two other "sides" are struggling to [[shift]] the edge between each
other, taking some heat off the players.
