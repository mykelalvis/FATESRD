Sails Full of Stars

# New Skills and Stunts

Use the skill list from [[Fate Core]] for this game, but remove the [[Drive]]
skill and add two new skills: Alchemy and Sail.

## Alchemy

Alchemy is the science of combining materials and chemicals in order to
produce other materials and chemicals with new properties. Alchemists
can produce poisonous gases, potent acids, healing elixirs, luminescent
fluids, and other useful mixtures. They cannot achieve true
transmutation, such as transforming lead into gold, though many frauds
are willing to sell fictional techniques for accomplishing this.

Alchemy is also the study of biological processes, including health,
illness, aging, and recovery. All modern medical treatment requires the
practice of alchemy. Even the preparation of folk remedies and botanical
cures is a basic form of alchemy. Competent diagnosis and treatment of
ailments requires specialized study, so characters must have the Doctor
stunt if they wish to help others recover from physical consequences.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: You can use Alchemy to overcome a variety of obstacles
where alchemical knowledge would be useful. For instance, you could mix
an acid to dissolve a sturdy lock, or you could determine the components
of an unknown alchemical mixture. Alchemy is useful for overcoming
medical obstacles as well, and it can be used to remove aspects of a
medical nature.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: When you have alchemical supplies and tools on
hand, you can create advantages. For instance, you could mix a gas and
release it into a guardhouse, leaving the soldiers inside [Quite
Sleepy]. Or you could distill an elixir which gives an ally
[Liquid Courage].

In addition, you can provide your allies with mixtures, which they can
later use to create advantages on their own. When your ally uses the
mixture, you roll Alchemy to create the desired aspect. Your ally might
need to roll to deliver the mixture, such as [[Shoot]] to throw a flask or
[[Stealth]] to pour a vial into someone's drink.

If you wish to create alchemical weapons, such as acids or explosives,
you can do so by creating an advantage. You or your allies could then
use the free invokes granted by the advantage you created to improve
their attacks.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: You cannot use Alchemy to attack directly. If you wish to
apply your alchemical knowledge and supplies to damage a specific
obstacle---for instance, trying to dissolve a sealed metal box---that is
better represented as an overcome action.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: You cannot normally use Alchemy to defend.

### Alchemy Stunts

**I've Drunk Worse:** You've grown accustomed to toxic fumes and
chemical burns. You can use Alchemy to defend against attacks and
aspects involving poisons, toxins, and other chemicals.

**Doctor:** Your alchemical studies include treating the ailments of the
human body. You can roll Alchemy to allow another character to begin
recovering physical consequences. Characters who have Alchemy at Average
(+1) or higher can provide you with teamwork bonuses on recovery rolls,
even if they don't have the Doctor stunt.

### Alchemy in Practice

To create an alchemical mixture, an alchemist needs access to three
things:

- **Tools:** flasks, burners, pipes, and retorts.
- **Materials:** liquids, powders, metals, and crystals.
- **Time:** Anywhere from a few minutes (to produce a simple acid) to
  several years (to produce a breakthrough in alchemical science).
  Typically, an alchemist can produce a simple alchemical
  mixture---such as a one-use gas bomb or a vial of antivenom---in
  less than an hour.

To set the difficulty of an Alchemy roll, consider not only the
magnitude of the task to be accomplished, but also the tools, materials,
and time available. When a character must work with a limited set of
tools, or with poor quality materials, or in a rush, increase the
difficulty.

## Sail

The practice of sailing a ship requires competence in reading
navigational charts, using instruments to determine one's position in
the solar system, measuring the local wind currents, and setting the
sails to produce the desired course and speed.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: While you are navigating a ship, the GM may ask you to
roll an overcome action to determine how quickly the vessel arrives at
its destination. This roll can be modified by stunts belonging to the
navigator and by the ship itself.

If you fail an overcome roll with Sail and want to succeed at a cost,
you can choose to damage the ship as your cost. In this case you're
pushing the ship past its limits, causing its structure or mechanisms to
suffer. By default, a minor cost produces a [[situation aspect]], such as
[Engine Stalled Out], and a major cost produces a consequence,
such as [Torn Mainsails].

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: A ship's navigator can roll Sail to put the
vessel in an advantageous position relative to an enemy vessel. The
enemy's navigator actively opposes this roll by using Sail. See Ship
Combat for more information on this.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: You can use Sail to try to ram an enemy vessel, as described
in Ship Combat.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: A ship's navigator can defend with Sail against [[Shoot]] or
Sail attacks made by enemy vessels, or against enemy Sail rolls used to
create an advantage.

### Sail Stunts

**Superior Tactics:** When it comes to naval battles, you've seen every
trick in the book. +2 when actively opposing Sail rolls to create
positional aspects.

**Second Star to the Right:** Charts and arithmetic mills will never
replace the instincts of a good navigator. +2 to Sail overcome rolls to
improve the speed of a journey.

## Other Skills and Stunts

Several [[Fate Core]] skills have additional uses in this game, as listed
below. We also give a few sample stunts.

### [[Athletics]]

Characters with higher [[Athletics]] will have an easier time getting around
in zero-gravity environments.

**No Gravity? No Problem:** While in zero gravity, you receive +2 to any
roll to move between zones or to move extra zones in a single action.

**Freefall Wrestling:** While in zero gravity, you can use [[Athletics]]
instead of [[Fight]] to make unarmed, hand-to-hand attacks against an
opponent.

### [[Crafts]]

Ship crews use [[Crafts]] to maintain and repair their vessels.

**A Finely Tuned Machine:** When you stack an advantage by invoking one
of your engineering-related aspects, and give it to an ally using your
ship's equipment to perform an action, you grant that ally a +3 bonus
instead of the usual +2.

**Miracle Worker:** Once per session, after you succeed on a [[Crafts]] roll
to begin recovering a ship's consequence when outside combat, you can
spend a [[fate point]] to immediately remove the consequence.

### [[Deceive]]

The art of deception can be a useful---if not necessarily
honorable---talent for a ship's captain.

**Subtle Signaling:** By understanding the relationship between lantern
signals and the hexagrams of the I Ching, you can construct signals that
carry hidden significance. To understand the hidden message, an observer
must have the Subtle Signaling stunt or must successfully overcome with
[[Lore]], opposed by your [[Deceive]].

**The Finest Snake Oil:** You've learned enough scientific jargon to
convince people that the flasks of colored vinegar you're selling are
elixirs of youth or miracle cure-alls. +2 to [[Deceive]] while trying to
convince someone that you've produced a remarkable feat of alchemy.

### [[Lore]]

Though modern weapons have transformed the face of warfare, the insights
of past battlefield masters such as Sun Tzu and Carl von Clausewitz are
critical for the education of any commander.

**Eightfold Formation:** From your study of battle formations, you know
how to arrange your troops for any situation. During crew combat, you
can use [[Lore]] instead of [[Will]] to benefit units under your command. See
the _Fate System Toolkit_ (page 167) for a list of these benefits.

**Empty Fort Strategy:** Your knowledge of armies and warfare allows you
to construct a convincing illusion on the battlefield. You can use [[Lore]]
instead of [[Deceive]] to create a plausible but untrue [[situation aspect]] on
a zone. Creating this aspect requires enough time before the enemy
arrives to arrange the scene appropriately---creating false tracks,
propping up rifles in windows, and so forth.

For instance, you might place [Well Garrisoned] on an empty
building, or [Bristling with Traps] on an otherwise ordinary
road. Enemies who see your illusion attempt to overcome using [[Notice]],
with a difficulty equal to the [[shift]]s of your [[Lore]] roll used to create
the illusion. Any enemies who fail this action will believe the aspect
is true, and will act accordingly.

### [[Notice]]

An experienced commander looking down on a battlefield will see more
than blood and chaos. A true strategist will see opportunities,
weaknesses, and---above all---the guiding hand of the opposing general.

**We Have Already Won:** Before a physical conflict begins, if you have
advance knowledge of the area in which the battle will take place, and
you have the opportunity to discuss tactics with allies, you can use
[[Notice]] to create an aspect on a single zone without actually being
there. This aspect represents the benefits of planning and scouting,
such as [Coordinated Ambush] or [We'll Hold Them At This
Pass]. You can use this stunt for crew battles and for
conflicts between individual characters.

**It's A Trap!:** +2 to [[Notice]] to detect hidden aspects, such as
[Concealed Trenches] or [Snipers Watching], on any
zone you can see.

### [[Provoke]]

Fear and anger can be effective tools for driving a crew to perform
extraordinary feats.

**Have At Them, You Dogs!:** You keep your troops motivated in combat by
bellowing a constant stream of colorful, inventive, and multi-lingual
insults. You can use [[Provoke]] instead of [[Will]] to benefit units under your
command during crew combat. See the _Fate System Toolkit_ (page 167) for
a list of these benefits.

**Iron Grip:** Your crew is too afraid of you to keep any secrets from
you. You can use [[Provoke]] instead of [[Empathy]] to detect changes in the
crew's mood or to discover any secrets or plots the crew is hiding from
you.

### [[Rapport]]

A charismatic leader can remove a crew's fear, doubts, and fatigue with
a few well-chosen words.

**Follow Me To Glory!:** You are an inspiring presence on the
battlefield. You can use [[Rapport]] instead of [[Will]] to benefit units under
your command during crew combat. See the _Fate System Toolkit_ (page
167) for a list of these benefits.

**Good Show!:** When you show approval of a job well done, you encourage
your allies to achieve greater success. Once per scene, if an ally
successfully creates an advantage, you can grant another free invoke on
the same aspect if you are close enough to issue encouragement or
congratulations. This does not require an action.

### [[Shoot]]

Napoleon himself started as an artillery officer, and used the firepower
of his cannons to devastate his enemies.

**Hit Them Where It Hurts:** When you successfully attack a ship, you
choose---rather than the defender---whether the ship must absorb the
attack with ship consequences or crew conditions. The target chooses
which specific consequences or conditions to use.

**Warning Shots:** a well-timed volley of cannon fire can discourage
enemy ships. Once per exchange, you can use [[Shoot]] to oppose an enemy
ship's attempt to create a position aspect against any ship.

### [[Will]]

A ship's captain must be decisive and determined, or else risk losing
the faith of the crew.

**Master and Commander:** Once per scene, when your crew or battle unit
performs a single action under your command, you can substitute your
[[Will]] for any skill the crew or unit would have used. This [[Will]] roll
cannot be improved with teamwork bonuses.

**One With the Ship:** Your sweat and blood keeps the ship going in the
worst circumstances. When the ship would take a consequence, your
character can instead choose to take an equivalent consequence.
