Sails Full of Stars

# Ship Combat

## Running the Conflict

Before combat begins, each ship's navigator must roll Sail to create an
aspect indicating its position relative to the other vessels. For
example:

- [The Asteroid Is Between Us]
- [We Have the Weather Gage]
- [Closing to Gun Range]

The navigator may be any PC or NPC crew member who is on or near the
bridge of the ship at the beginning of the conflict. To determine the
order that the ships create their aspects, compare the [[Notice]] ranks of
the navigators, just as you would to determine turn order during a
normal exchange. When declaring each aspect, state which ships it
affects. Each of these ships can actively oppose this attempt by rolling
Sail.

You may wish to use index cards to represent individual ships and
positional aspects. For a positional aspect between two ships---such as
[In the Pirate's Blind Spot]---place a card between them,
drawing arrows as desired to show motion or targeting. For one that
affects multiple opponents---such as [We're Leaving Them Far
Behind]---place the card near the ship creating the aspect and
note on the card which ships it affects.

Certain activities can only occur once per ship in each exchange:
_maneuvers_, _repairs_, _gunnery_, and _signaling_. All four of these
activities can occur simultaneously. The PCs can directly command any of
these activities, one activity per PC, or the crew can execute any
number of these activities on their own, as described in the "Crew
Actions" section. When the crew performs an activity on their own, use
their own [[Notice]] to determine their place in the turn order; when a PC
takes command of an activity, use that PC's [[Notice]] instead.

**Maneuvers:** To alter a position aspect, the ship's navigator rolls
overcome using Sail. Any ships affected by the altered aspect can
actively oppose with Sail. Successfully changing the position aspect
removes the prior aspect and grants one or two free invocations or a
boost on the new aspect, as per the usual rules for creating an
advantage.

You can attempt to create a position aspect between your ship and
several other ships at once. In this case, each of those ships actively
and independently opposes you. Assign the new aspect to each ship that
fails to oppose your action.

Ramming a ship requires two exchanges. On the first exchange, your
ship's navigator rolls Sail to create a [Bearing Down On the
Enemy] position aspect targeting an enemy ship, which can
actively oppose with Sail. While this aspect exists, your ship's
navigator can attack with Sail to ram the targeted ship, which defends
with Sail. If the attack is successful, determine damage as usual, and
then roll Sail again to defend _your own ship_ against your own ram
attack. If you do not successfully defend, damage your own ship as
normal. If your defense ties your attack, the resulting boost goes to
the enemy ship you rammed; if you took out the ship you rammed, the
boost goes to an enemy of the GM's choice.

**Repairs:** The ship's crew can roll Craft to attempt to remove
damage-related aspects from the ship. During a conflict, the crew cannot
attempt to recover damage-related consequences, but they can create
aspects to represent temporary repairs, such as [Held Together with
Twine and Hope] or [We Didn't Need That Gear Anyway].
Any character on the ship can invoke a temporary repair aspect in
response to an opponent invoking a consequence on the ship.

**Gunnery:** A ship can fire its guns at a single target per exchange.
This can be represented as an attack action or create an advantage
action, attempting to create an aspect on an enemy ship, such as
[Shredded Sails]. The targeted vessel can defend or actively
oppose, as appropriate, using Sail.

**Signaling:** Once per exchange, a ship can transmit a single message
using its signaling lanterns. To judge whether a message can be sent
during a single exchange, assume that signaling speed is roughly similar
to that of Morse code---about forty words per minute. Normally,
signaling does not require a roll, but it does use the signaling
character's action for the exchange.

## Other Actions During Ship Combat

Characters who are not taking command of the four main ship activities
listed in the prior section may take other actions during the conflict
as desired and necessary. For instance, while a ship-to-ship battle is
raging, the PCs might also need to defend themselves against a swarm of
Uranian ice spiders loose on the ship, or they might need to negotiate
with a saboteur who has barricaded herself in the ship's magazine with a
box of matches and the vessel's store of prometheum.

You can divide up ship decks and compartments into zones to resolve
conflicts occurring inside a ship, such as a munity or a boarding
action. Zones within a ship have no bearing on ship-to-ship conflict,
including taking command of the crew.

## Ship Consequences and Conditions

When a ship takes [[shift]]s of damage, the defender may absorb them using
ship consequences, crew conditions, or both.

Consequences represent battle damage, mechanical failures, and other
persistent problems with the ship. Ships can take the usual three
consequences---mild, moderate, and severe.

Conditions represent crew casualties or missing crew members. The _Fate
System Toolkit_ explains how to use conditions on page 18. The following
conditions are available for a ship's crew:

- **Bruised:** 1 point
- **Battered:** 1 point
- **Light Losses:** 2 points
- **Light Losses:** 2 points
- **Heavy Losses:** 4 points
- **Heavy Losses:** 4 points

The Bruised and Battered conditions are fleeting: remove them as soon as
the crew has time to rest and dress their wounds. The Light Losses and
Heavy Losses conditions are sticky: you can only remove them after you
replace the lost crew members. Each Light Losses condition represents a
loss of one-tenth the ship's maximum crew, while each Heavy Losses
condition represents a loss of one-quarter the maximum crew.

If you are deliberately sailing with less than a ship's maximum
crew---because you've sent some of the crew off on a raiding mission,
for instance, or because you've captured a merchant ship and only sent a
few crew members to sail it---you must take a combination of Light
Losses and Heavy Losses conditions to cover the missing crew. If you
can't take enough conditions to cover the shortfall---that is, if you
have less than three-tenths the ship's full crew---you cannot mount a
competent defense in battle. If you enter a combat situation, your ship
is immediately taken out.

To begin recovering a consequence that represents damage to the ship,
you must roll Repair against the consequence in question, as normal.
This task requires several hours of in-game time, and must occur while
the ship is not involved in combat.

On a successful Repair roll, rename the consequence to reflect the
ongoing repairs. For example, [Gaping Hole in the Hull] might
become [Hastily Patched-Over Breach]. After the appropriate
amount of game time passes, remove the consequence.

GMs, you may wish to limit the number of consequences and conditions
that an unimportant NPC ship can take, just as you would for a nameless
or supporting NPC.
