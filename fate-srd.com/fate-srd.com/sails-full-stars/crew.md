Sails Full of Stars

# Crew

## Crew Actions

The ship's crew includes general hands as well as officers who fill any
roles the PCs haven't. The crew can perform any ship duty on their own,
including navigating and plotting courses, operating the sails and guns,
repairing damage, keeping lookout, operating signal lanterns,
transferring cargo, and so forth. When the crew performs a task on their
own, they roll actions using their own skill rank .

If a PC takes direct command of the crew to perform a specific task,
roll using the PC's skill rank. In these cases, the PC must be actively
involved in the task alongside the crew. The crew can perform any
reasonable number of tasks at the same time, with or without PC
leadership, but any one PC may only take command of one task at a time.

> Bailey orders the ship's guns to fire. He decides to lead the gun
> crew, so he uses his own [[Shoot]] rank instead of the crew's [[Shoot]] rank.
> Shortly after, the ship is damaged by return fire, and Bailey wants to
> lead the repair effort. To do this, he gives up command of the gun
> crew. When the guns are fired again, the crew operates the guns, using
> their own [[Shoot]] rank.

You may wish to invent names and backgrounds for some NPC crew members,
but you don't need to choose skills for these characters---they have the
skills and skill ranks as the rest of the crew.

## Crew Combat

When running battles with large portions of the crew, such as
ship-to-ship boarding actions, use the mass combat rules from the _Fate
System Toolkit_ (page 163) with the modifications in this section.

At the start of the battle, divide friendly and enemy forces into units
of equal size, such as five or ten combatants per unit. Create enough
units so that each player can command at least one unit, but without
creating too many units to track easily. If the units have fewer than
five combatants each, run the battle as a normal conflict, not a mass
combat, and group nameless NPCs together using the mob rules from _Fate
Core_ (page 216).

Next, determine the statistics for each unit. Units composed of ship's
crew will have the skills and the crew aspect associated with their
ship. For non-crew units, just assign skills as appropriate using the
templates for nameless NPC's. Units have no stress boxes and 1 mild
consequence. If you're using maps or other props, use a two-sided
counter to represent each unit. When a unit takes a mild consequence,
flip the counter over. When it is taken out, remove the counter from the
battlefield.

During the battle, you can combine units into groups. A group of units
acts as a single unit, combining their skills using the teamwork rules
from [[Fate Core]] (page 174). The entire group can benefit from having a
leader as if it were a single unit. However, if you roll [[Will]] to remove
a consequence from your troops, remove a consequence from one unit in
your group, not from all the units in your group.

Multiple characters can attach themselves to a unit group, but only one
attached character can serve as the group's leader. Attached characters
who are not leaders can invoke their aspects on behalf of their unit,
and can engage enemy leaders in single combat, but they cannot perform
any of the other functions of a leader.

Units use [[Fight]] to attack enemies in the same zone, and use [[Shoot]] to
attack enemies in distant zones. Attacked units defend against [[Fight]]
with [[Fight]] or [[Athletics]], and defend against [[Shoot]] with [[Athletics]]. When a
group takes [[shift]]s from a successful attack, the player controlling the
group chooses how to assign those [[shift]]s among the comprising units and
attached characters.

A unit cannot prevent another unit from entering its zone. However, a
unit entering a zone with an enemy unit cannot leave that zone until the
next exchange. Also, whenever a zone contains opposing units, any of
those units can overcome using [[Fight]] to move an enemy unit into an
adjacent zone. The target can oppose this action with [[Fight]] or
[[Athletics]].

At the end of the combat, take note of which units are uninjured,
injured, and taken out. After combat, injured units immediately recover
and become available for duty. If any crew members are taken out, each
character with the Doctor stunt can roll Alchemy once against a Mediocre
(+0) difficulty to attempt to prevent the crew members from dying.
Characters with Alchemy at Average (+1) or higher can provide teamwork
bonuses to these rolls, even without the Doctor stunt. Each [[shift]]
preserves the life of ten crew members. Any crew members who were taken
out and not healed with Alchemy will perish.
