# Aspects & Fate Points

See [[aspect]]s

## Fate Points

You **spend [[fate point]]s**---which you keep track of with pennies or glass beads or poker chips or some other tokens---to unlock the power of aspects and make them help you. You **earn** [[fate point]]s by letting a character aspect be compelled against you to complicate the situation or make your life harder. Be sure to keep track of the [[fate point]]s you have left at the end of the session---if you have [[Who Do You Want To Be|more than your refresh]], you start the next session with the [[fate point]]s you ended this session with.

> You earned a lot of [[fate point]]s during your game session, ending the day with five [[fate point]]s. Your refresh is 2, so you'll start with five [[fate point]]s the next time you play. But another player ends the same session with just one [[fate point]]. His refresh is 3, so he'll  begin the next session with 3 [[fate point]]s, not just the one he had  left over.

## What Kinds of Aspects Are There?

There's an endless variety of [[aspect]]s, but no matter what they're called they all work pretty much the same way. The main difference is how long they stick around before going away.

### Character Aspects

These aspects are on your character sheet, such as your [[high concept]]  and [[trouble]] .  They describe personality traits, important details about your past, relationships you have with others, important items or titles you possess, problems you're dealing with or goals you're working toward, or reputations and obligations you carry. These aspects only change under very unusual circumstances; most never will.

> **Examples**: [Captain of the Skyship Nimbus]; [On the Run From the Knights of the Circle]; [Attention to Detail]; [I Must Protect My Brother]

### Situation Aspects

Things that are part of the current situation. See [[[[situation aspect]]]]

### Consequences

Injuries that you have suffered. See [[ConsequenceX]]s

### Boosts

Temporary [[aspect]]s you get to use once.  See [[boost]]

### PVP (Player versus player)

The only time that [[fate point]] might not go to the GM is when you're in [[conflict]] with another player. If you are, and you invoke one of that player's [[#Character Aspects]]s to help you out against them, they will get the [[fate point]] instead of the GM once the scene is over.

## What Do You Do With Aspects?

There are three big things you can do with aspects: [[#Invoking Aspects|invoke]] aspects, [[#Compelling Aspects|compel]] aspects, and use aspects to [[#Establishing Facts|establish facts]].

### Invoking Aspects

Using an [[aspect]] to [someone's] advantage.  See [[invoke|invoking aspects]]

#### Free invocations

Sometimes invoking an aspect is free.  See [[invoke#Free invocations|free invocations]]

#### Compelling Aspects
If you're in a situation where having or being around a certain aspect means your character's life is more dramatic or complicated, anyone can compel the aspect. You can even compel it on yourself---that's called a self-compel. Compels are the most common way for players to earn more [[fate point]]s.

#### Declaring a Detail

See [[invoke#Declaring a Story Detail|here]]

#### Establishing Facts

The final thing that [[aspect]]s can do is **establish facts** in the game. 

### How Many Fate Points Does the GM Get?

As GM, you don't need to track [[fate point]]s for each NPC, but that doesn't mean you get an unlimited number. Start each scene with a pool of one [[fate point]] per PC that's in the scene. Spend [[fate point]]s from this pool to invoke aspects (and consequences) against the PCs. When it's empty, you can't invoke aspects against them.

How can you increase the size of your pool? When a player compels one of an NPC's aspects, add the [[fate point]] to your pool. If that compel ends the scene, or when an NPC gives in, instead add those [[fate point]]s to your pool at the start of the next scene.

[[Fate Point]]s you award for compels do NOT come from this pool. You never have to worry about running out of [[fate point]]s to award for compels.


## Composing Good Aspects

When you need to think of a good aspect (we're mainly talking about character and situation aspects here), think about two things:

- How the aspect might help you---when you'd invoke it.
- How it might hurt you---when it would be compelled against you.

For example:

[_I'll Get You, von Stendahl!_]

- Invoke this when acting against von Stendahl to improve your   chances.
- Get a [[fate point]] when your dislike for von Stendahl makes you do something foolish to try to get him.

[_Hair Trigger Nerves_]

- Invoke this when being extra vigilant and careful would help you.
- Get a [[fate point]] when this causes you to be jumpy and be distracted   by threats that aren't really there.

Obviously, your trouble aspect is supposed to cause problems---and thereby make your character's life more interesting and get you [[fate point]]s---so it's okay if that one's a little more one-dimensional, but other character and situation aspects should be double-edged.
