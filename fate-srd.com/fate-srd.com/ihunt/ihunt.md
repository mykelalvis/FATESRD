# #iHunt

#iHunt is a story telling game about killing monsters in the gig
economy. In it, you play millennials scraping by paycheck to paycheck to
make ends meet. A gig app called #iHunt offers them more money than
they've ever made to hit the streets and kill vampires, werewolves,
demons, and anything else that goes bump in the night.
