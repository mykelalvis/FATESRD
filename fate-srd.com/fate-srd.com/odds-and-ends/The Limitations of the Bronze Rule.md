# The Limitations of the Bronze Rule

Many people who get entranced by Fate do so in part because of [[The Bronze Rule]] (also known as the Fate
Fractal):

> **In Fate, you can treat anything in the game world like it's a character. Anything can have aspects, skills, stunts, stress tracks, and consequences if you need it to.**
>
> This is called this the Bronze Rule, but you may also have heard of it as the Fate Fractal if you pay attention to the Internet. You've already seen some examples of this in other places on the site; you give your game its own aspects during creation, you place situation aspects on the environment as well as on characters, and the GM can let environmental hazards attack as if they had skills.


That there are [[bronze-rule|limitations]] gets a bit touched on in the [[Fate System Toolkit]], but not well. This post is intended to be a better explanation of when you can apply [[The Bronze Rule]] with full effect. To start, my quick rewriting of [[The Bronze Rule]] is:

> In Fate, you can treat anything in the game world _capable of taking action_ like it's a character. They can have aspects, skills/approaches, stunts, stress tracks, and consequences if you need them to. Everything else can have difficulty ratings, aspects, stunts, stress tracks, and consequences as needed, but only things that can take action can have skills or approaches.

It's less catchy, I know, but it's accurate.

## Actors vs. Obstacles vs. Things

The best way to look at this issue is to answer three questions about whatever narrative element you're looking at:

- Is it capable of its own action?
- If not capable of action, is it capable of resisting action?
- If not capable of action, is it something that can be possessed?

**Actor: If something is capable of action on its own at least some of the time*****,*** then it can be treated like a character. It can have all that good stuff --- aspects, skills/approaches, stress & consequences, etc. --- and take its own actions. (t might not have all of that stuff, but it _can_.

**Obstacle: If something isn't capable of directly taking action, but can resist action,** then it's an obstacle when you're doing an action against it. It can have aspects, a difficulty or set of difficulties, possibly a number of victories needed to overcome it as a challenge, and so on.

**Thing: If something isn't capable of directly taking action, but can be possessed by an actor that can,** then it's a device (in the narrative and possibly common sense) that can have aspects and may convey stunts and other rules to the wielder. Maybe you have a _**Legendary Sword**_ that gives you Weapon:3 against dragons --- that's the sort of thing I'm talking about.

Here's where we get a little weird: in a narrative sense, a _**Raging House Fire**_ or [_**Steranko Security
System**_](http://leverage.wikia.com/wiki/Steranko_Security_Systems) are capable of taking action. That's a limited set of actions, and they aren't sentient or sapient entities (in most universes, anyway), but they're still taking action against and resisting the actions of the PCs. And many elements that we consider just worthy of possessing can suddenly offer resistance --- the _**Legendary Sword**_ would certainly provide an obstacle for someone trying to destroy it, but it wouldn't act on its own to combat it.

(Unless we, in trying to destroy the sword, learn that it's capable of psychic communication and mental assault, which makes it an actor.)

Note: Being capable of action implies being capable of resisting action, though when that's not true we get into a funky edge case. I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.

## The Lure of the Bronze Rule

Just as when people first discover aspects, [they try to apply the concept to everything to a game's detriment](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923203556/http://ryanmacklin.com/2013/11/fate-misconceptions-and-aspect-spamming "Fate Misconceptions and Aspect Spamming"), many people when they first stumble upon the Bronze Rule try to apply it to non-actors and either flounder a bunch or make a game work in spite of the hurdle. (This is especially true of mystery-as-character rules, which is its own rant.) So when you're applying the Bronze Rule, ask yourself two things:

- Is this thing actually capable of action against other characters, or does something else take action on its behalf?
- Does what I'm making really need an added layer of complication by making aspects, skills, stunts, whatever?

Hopefully by deliberately thinking about what the Bronze Rule does and is/isn't useful for will help you in your Fate games.

## Additional: Why People Do This

_(Edited to add 8/4/14)_ It occurs to me now that part of why people do this is because they want to create some sort of stakes element alongside a fight, and believe that since one side is fighting, that they other side must use some sort of stress-based way of tracking if they're willing. [After reading this piece from Bill Garrett](http://station53.blogspot.com/2014/08/avengers-accelerated-sacrifice-play.html), I realized that make people try to use the wrong tool for the job because they don't realize there's a better tool: [[Fateful Concepts - Hacking Contests#Contests Under Fire|contests under fire]].

N.B.: Some of this came up as I made the [Fate build for _Achtung! Cthulhu_](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/131136/Achtung-Cthulhu-Investigators--Keepers-Guide-Fate--BUNDLE&affiliate_id=144937), notably while making vehicle rules and the monsters. Perhaps you want to check it out for the various Fate goodness I dumped into it.
