## Creating Factions

After your group has decided your setting's [[fate-core#The Setting's Big Issues|Big Issues]], each
player names a Faction, a collection of individuals within the community
who have a perspective on the issues the community faces. These Factions
might be formal organizations, like a professional guild or a political
party, but they often have more porous boundaries that allow community
members to move in and out of the Faction as the characters' beliefs
change. Many Factions have unofficial structures and names, like "**the
jocks**" or "**the nobility**," and some Factions may be a subset of
a larger group like "**poor dockworkers**" or "**devout Hindus**".

Regardless of formal structure, each Faction is unified by Beliefs,
attitudes about the Big Issues that draw like-minded people together.
There may be other requirements, such as a certain amount of wealth or a
particular job, that the characters have to meet to be considered a part
of the Faction, but holding acting in accordance with the Faction's
Beliefs is central to membership. These Beliefs are not necessarily
mutually exclusive, and a character may belong to more than one Faction
in the setting. The players' characters will be strongly associated
with the Factions they create, although they need not agree with all of
the Faction's Beliefs.

> Octavio is playing in a pulp Los Angeles in 1946 that follows the
> adventures of secret heroes fighting Nazis post-World War II. The
> group has already decided on one current issue ("The War is Over!")
> and one impending issue ("The Rise of the Thule Society").
> Octavio's planning on making a character who fought in Europe, so he
> creates the Faction **Returning Soldiers**.

### Are Beliefs Aspects?

Yes, albeit limited Aspects. Since not every member of a Faction is
faithful to the dogma of the organization, Beliefs are more limited than
other Aspects. Members of the Faction can be compelled to follow
Beliefs, but they can deny the compel without spending a [[fate point]]. At
the same time, Beliefs can only be invoked on Factional Skill rolls, and
cannot be invoked when individual characters take action.

## Faction Paragons

Once Factions are created, each player identifies a Paragon for the
Faction, an NPC exemplar of the Faction's Beliefs and traditions. The
GM can stat up each Paragon if needed, but the players have the first
say in defining the Paragon's look, outlook, and temperament.

Paragons come in all shapes and sizes, but they generally are important
political and cultural figures to their Faction. It's pretty rare to
find a Paragon who doesn't care about the Faction or the issues in the
setting. Paragons wield an enormous amount of informal authority within
the Faction, and they use that authority when it suits their interests.

> Octavio decides that he wants the Paragon of his faction to be Ruben
> Fox, an African-American soldier who fought in the Pacific during the
> War. Octavio describes Ruben as a tall, broad man beloved by the
> soldiers he fought with and now works to fight for resources for the
> returning veterans of Los Angeles. He's well-known to the **Returning
> Veterans**.

## Faction Beliefs

Factions are important to the setting specifically because they have
viewpoints about the Big Issues the protagonists face during the game.
Beliefs are often perceived solutions to Big Issues, but they can also
be new perspectives on the conflict to come or attitudes about how other
Factions relate to the problem.

To add Beliefs to Factions, each player creates a Belief that their
Faction holds about one Big Issue. The Belief is a complete statement,
such as "_The only true king of the land is Lord Trellian_" or "_Our
rivals at the State Department are responsible for the terrorist
threat._" The more aggressive the Faction's Beliefs are, the more
active and present that Faction will be in the setting.

After players add a starting Belief to each faction, each player should
add an additional Belief to a different Faction that interests them. The
Faction creator has final veto power over the added Belief. Many members
of the Faction may only tenuously support some of the Beliefs,
especially if the Faction has a fairly informal authority structure.

> Octavio thinks that the **Returning Veterans** are pretty concerned
> about the Thule Society, so he creates the Belief "The Thule Society
> is the greatest threat America faces." for the Faction. Another
> member of Octavio's group, Amy, adds a new Belief, declaring that
> "Civilians don't understand the War." Octavio likes that Belief, so
> he notes both Beliefs on his Faction's sheet.

## Faction Skills

Each Faction has the following Skills in addition to their core Beliefs:

- **Fealty:** The intensity of the Faction's member's adherence to
  the Beliefs of their Faction and the formality of authority
  structures within the Faction.

- **Fellowship:** The trust and goodwill members hold toward each
  other, especially in times of conflict about the Faction's Beliefs.

- **Force:** The Faction's ability to take action in the world
  without the PC's direct intervention.

- **Fraternity:** The Faction's ability to generate resources and
  information for its members.

After naming the Faction, creating a Paragon for the Faction, and
establishing Beliefs, players assign ranks to the Faction's Skills: one
Mediocre (+0), one Average (+1), one Fair (+2), and one Good (+3). These
skills can be improved throughout play if the members of the Faction
pursue milestones associated with the Faction (see Improving Factions).

Each Belief the Faction holds gets a stress track. The highest ranked
Belief receives a number of stress boxes equal to the Faction's Fealty;
each additional belief receiving one fewer stress box to a minimum of
one. This stress represents how strongly the Faction holds that
particular Belief, and how much conflict would be required for that
Faction to reexamine or alter a Belief (see [Beliefs in
Conflict](#beliefs-in-conflict)).

In addition to the stress tracks for each Belief, each member of the
Faction gets a new stress track in addition to Mental and Physical -
Status stress. Like Mental and Physical stress boxes, Status stress
starts with just two boxes, but improves to three boxes if the
Faction's Fellowship is at least Average (+1) and to four boxes if
Fellowship is Good (+3) or better. Characters can have as many Status
stress tracks as

### Fealty

Fealty is drawn from the authority structures and Beliefs of the
Faction. Factions with strong Fealty both hold tightly to the Beliefs
that unify the Faction and regularly police the Faction for dissidence.

**Overcome an obstacle:** Use Fealty to rally the forces of a Faction
present in a scene, uniting them in common cause when threatened or
dismayed.

**Create an advantage:** Fealty can be used to create aspects arising
from internal consensus or agreement (We're All Behind You) or shared
narratives or sacrifice (The Battle of York).

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Fealty can be used to remove a member from a Faction by
attacking their Status. If the Faction takes out a member, that member
faces repercussions ranging from punishment to expulsion.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Fealty is used to defend against attacks on the Faction's
Beliefs when no single character could act as the defender.

### Fellowship

Each Faction holds its membership in differing regard. Some Factions
trust and believe in the membership as a whole, implying that members
should value the relationships they have with each other. For that
reason, Fellowship is the skill that determines the depth of the Status
stress track.

**Overcome an obstacle:** Without active leadership, a Faction uses
Fellowship to overcome challenges, especially a lack of morale.
Fellowship can also be used to help characters recover from consequences
stemming from social conflicts with other Factions.

**Create an advantage:** Use Fellowship to create aspects that represent
the inspiration the Faction gives to a character (Thy [[Will]] Be Done) or
the unifying effects of mutual support within the Faction (My Brother's
Keeper).

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Fellowship isn't used for attacks.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Fellowship isn't used to defend.

### Force

Factions are capable of taking action without the PCs' direct
involvement. When they do so, they roll Force to determine the
effectiveness of their actions.

**Overcome an obstacle:** Force allows Factions to overcome direct
obstacles ranging from knocking down physical barriers to rounding up
criminals off the street.

**Create an advantage:** Use Force to create aspects representative of
immediate spoils of action. Members of your Faction might create An
Opening in the Enemy's Ranks or find a Collection of Stolen Goods when
interrupting burglars. You can also use Force to gather members together
in a mob to go and attack a target.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Use Force when mobs of the Faction attempt to attack targets
in a conflict.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Use Force when mobs of the Faction are directly attacked.

### Fraternity

Some organizations are better at supporting their members than others.
While Fellowship measures how the membership views each other,
Fraternity is the skill that generates resources and solves problems
through the Faction's connections and relationships.

**Overcome an obstacle:** Use Fraternity to get past problems the
Faction's connections can solve. If a member of the Faction can make a
phone call to get doors opened, Fraternity is the right skill for the
job.

**Create an advantage:** Use Fraternity to create aspects representing
shared resources that the membership of the Faction can contribute to a
cause. These resources can be broad, but they generally will come from
collective action like a tithing (Loaded Collection Plate) or the
strength of weak ties (My Union Brother Knows a Guy).

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Fraternity isn't used for attacks.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Fraternity isn't used to defend.

#### Who Rolls For The Faction?

For the most part, the Faction is under the control of the GM, like any
other collection of NPCs. However, the players are clear about who needs
to be convinced, misled, or coerced in order for the Faction to take
action: the Paragon. In the cases that the Paragon is convinced to take
action, its totally fine to have the players roll the dice to see the
effectiveness of the Faction's actions.

> Since the **Returning Veterans** are a pretty loose group, Octavio
> decides to make Fealty the weakest Skill for the group, giving them a
> Mediocre (+0) Fealty Skill. He decides that the strongest Skill will
> be Fellowship at Good (+3), followed by Fraternity at Fair (+2); the
> veterans have a lot of trust and goodwill toward each other and are
> likely to share resources and contacts. Octavio puts Force at Average
> (+1), since the veterans aren't too eager to get in to a new round of
> conflicts in the years following the War.
>
> The **Returning Veterans** Mediocre (+0) Fealty Skill means that all
> of their Beliefs will have only a single stress box. Their Good (+3)
> Fellowship, however, means that Octavio will have a Status stress
> track with four boxes; his Faction can handle a lot of internal
> stress.

#### Status Stress

When characters would normally take Mental stress from social conflicts
with members of their Faction, especially when those members are trying
to use Fealty to attack a character, the targeted character should use
the Status stress track instead of the normal Mental stress track. If a
character is taken out through this kind of conflict, the character is
expelled from the Faction. When a player concedes these kinds of
conflicts, a common concession is for the player s character to fall in
line with the Faction.

## Beliefs In Conflict

Broadly speaking, there are three ways Beliefs come into conflict:

- Characters challenge their own Faction's Beliefs

- Characters challenge another character's beliefs

- Characters challenge another Faction's Beliefs

**When you challenge your own Faction's Beliefs**, roll [[Provoke]] against
the Faction's Fealty. Generally this takes place as a conflict, with
the Faction marking down stress on the Belief track and you marking down
stress on your Status track. If you win the conflict, you'll be able to
change the Faction's belief. If you lose, you'll face repercussions at
the hands of the group. Individual characters may oppose you, in which
case they have the option of taking some of the stress you create
instead of directing it to the Belief.

**When you challenge another character's Beliefs**, roll [[Provoke]]
against the other character's [[Will]] as normal. However, both you and
your target can mark stress on your Belief stress tracks as well as your
Mental stress track if the conversation is reasonably public (i.e. if
other members of your Faction could know about the outcome). If your
Belief stress track fills up, however, your Faction must reexamine or
reevaluate the Belief. This could lead to your Faction strengthening its
beliefs, especially if the person provoking it is seen as an adversary.

**When you challenge another Faction's Beliefs**, you roll [[Provoke]]
against the Faction's Fealty, as if you were challenging your own
Faction's Beliefs. However, since you aren't a member of the Faction,
your position is considerably more tenuous. If you are successful at
forcing the Faction to reevaluate its Beliefs, you may find that members
of the Faction who were true believers attempt to take revenge on you
for your disruptive influence.

> Octavio's character, Ralph Gabaldon, is concerned that the Returning
> Veterans have ignored the threat that the new city council elections
> pose to veteran's issues because they are too focused on the Thule
> Society. He decides he's going to confront the group, and heads down
> to a bar where he knows many veterans will be at after hours. He rolls

> Fealty and succeeds by one [[shift]], all he needs to move the Veterans.
