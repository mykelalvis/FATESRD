The adventurers slowly creep down a dimly-lit corridor. The damp
stonework glistens in the dancing of their torches. Then ahead of them
they see it: the entrance to the long-forgotten throne room. The thief
makes her way forward to inspect the door, but when she reaches out to
touch it, blue, translucent light shimmers across its surface and blasts
her back into the hallway behind her. She gets back up, shakes off the
pain, and gives a nod to her unlikely ally. Knowing what he has to do,
an old man with a long white beard steps forward and begins muttering
forgotten words under his breath. He methodically waves his hands in a
circular pattern. "I've moved mountains with magic, slain mighty
beasts, and calmed the fiercest of storms." He sighs as he thinks to
himself. "But today, today I must open a door." A familiar blue energy
pulses from his hands and ripples across the door's surface. Then,
after a moment, the light dissipates into the air around them. With a
click, the door slowly opens, revealing the treasures and dangers that
lie ahead.

High Fantasy Magic is a simple, freeform magic system designed for Fate
Core and Fate Accelerated. Its goal is to be a drop-in magic system with
a high fantasy tone while sticking closely to [[Fate Core]] and providing
the same amount of flexibility in character creation and progression.
There are no spell lists. Instead, the players can choose which types of
magic they can use via a list of [magic
disciplines](#magic-disciplines2). Then, the players are encouraged to
use the power they have in whatever creative ways they can think of. The
freeform nature of this magic system allows for simple adjudication of
the rules and a low barrier to entry.# Overview

## Permission & Cost

To be a magic user, your character must have a permission aspect to
justify their magical abilities, as well as any number of [magic
disciplines](#magic-disciplines2) to allow usage of each type of magic.

### Permission Aspect

All magic users must have an aspect to justify their use of magic.
Whether it is included in an existing aspect or a new one all together,
your permission aspect must include the source of your magic in some
way. The source of your magic is how you obtained your powers. Your
source gives the group more information about your character and her
powers, but it also serves as a flaw for your GM to compel. Each source
includes a casting skill, which is talked about in more detail in the
Important Skills section, later on. Choose one of the three following
sources and incorporate it into one of your character aspects.

#### Ancestral Heritage

Casting Skill: [[Rapport]] or Flashy

Common Titles: Sorcerer

Your ancestors were magically gifted; their power flows through your
veins. As a result, you have naturally inherited their abilities. Magic
users with the Ancestral Heritage have not gone through all of the
training of a wizard or a sage, and their magic tends to occasionally go
haywire as a result. This can result in spells affecting the wrong
target or even producing random results. Example aspects: Arrogant Elven
sorcerer, Descendant of the Great Mazul

#### Divine Patron

Casting Skill: [[Empathy]] or Careful

Common Titles: Acolyte, priest, cleric, shaman, warlock

You are a disciple of a deity or some other-worldly being. In return,
you have been blessed with magical abilities. You can occasionally
communicate with your patron, but when you do, the responses you receive
are generally vague and puzzling. Magic users with the Divine Patron
source are subject to the whims of their deity. Patrons may require
their disciples to act according to a certain code of ethics, or aid in
specific quests. They also may weaken or take away magical abilities if
a disciple is not obeying their laws. Example aspects: Dwarven priest of
Thanin: The Just, The last disciple of Argoth

#### Relentless Training

Casting Skill: [[Lore]] or Clever

Common Titles: Mage, wizard, sage, scholar

You have not inherited your magical abilities, but instead, you have
trained long and hard to do what you do. Years of your life have been
spent studying old tomes and testing magical theories. Magic users with
the Relentless Training source are usually holed up somewhere while they
perfect their abilities. Wizards and the like know a great deal, but
most of their non-magical knowledge is just that: knowledge. They have
not had many chances to apply that knowledge in the real world. Example
aspects: Snoody human wizard, Apprentice of Hezir: The Magnificent.

### Magic Disciplines

Magic disciplines represent the types of magic that you are able to use,
regardless of how you obtained the ability. Once you have a permission
aspect, you must choose one or more magic disciplines in order to use
magic. For a list of the available magic disciplines, see page 15.

## Using Magic

Once you have a permission aspect and one or more magic disciplines, you
can use magic. This is done via your existing skill list. When you would
like to use magic to solve a problem, ask yourself the following
questions: "What is the character doing?" and "Why is it worthy of a
roll?" Once you have answered these questions, use the answers to help
determine which skill should be used.

For example, I have a character named Radcliff "Rad" Longfellow. In
order to use magic, Rad has the aspect Grumpy old wizard, and the
disciplines: Energy, Fire, and Illusion. If I want to have Rad shoot a
fireball, I can roll Rad's [[Shoot]] skill. If I want him to create a force
field out of Energy, I might roll his [[Crafts]] skill, since he is creating
a barrier. If I want him to trick someone with an Illusion, I can roll
[[Deceive]]. Then any narration that comes out of that action can be a
magical one.

## Fate Accelerated

All of the examples used throughout this guide reference [[Fate Core]]
skills rather than the approaches from Fate Accelerated. This is because
using magic with approaches is much easier to grasp. You can still use
this system with Fate Accelerated by applying the same principles.

## Important Skills

All skills are still important for magic users, but the following two
tend to come up especially often when dealing with magic.

### Casting Skill

Each of the sources of magic above brings with it a casting skill. The
casting skill is simply the skill that you use to perform magic.
Generally, you will be using whichever skill that best represents the
challenging part of the current action. However, sometimes it is clear
that a roll is needed, but no skill fits the action perfectly. Other
times, the difficult part of an action is casting the spell itself. In
these cases, use your casting skill.

### [[Will]]

The [[Will]] skill is more important for all characters than usual, because
it is used for resisting most hostile magical effects. It can also be
used by Magic Caster to maintain a spell. If someone wants to overcome a
magical effect that you created, you can roll [[Will]] to defend against it,
if it makes sense in the narrative.

# Balancing Magic

## Setting Difficulties

Now, the question of how difficulties are set may be running through
your head. Don't worry, we've got you covered! You can use the rules
you already know from [[Fate Core]], along with a few additional tips.

### GM Tools

Before we talk about specifics, let's go over the tools at your
disposal. The most obvious way to set a difficulty is when we have
passive opposition. The game master (GM) picks a number that represents
the difficulty. This works for unopposed actions, but it doesn't help
when there is someone actively working against the action.

For opposed actions, the opposition generally sets the difficulty of a
spell by rolling an appropriate skill to oppose it. If Rad shoots a
fireball at a goblin, the goblin rolls [[Athletics]] to evade. In that case,
nothing else is needed. However, if Rad instead wanted to transform the
goblin into a blue whale, the goblin's [[Will]] skill probably isn't an
adequate difficulty for such a powerful spell.

The simplest tool you have for something like this is setting passive
opposition anyway. Then, take the higher of the two, both active and
passive oppositions. This means the goblin can still roll [[Will]] to
defend, but if his result is less than the passive opposition, Rad's
roll would have to beat the passive opposition instead of the goblin's
roll.

The second tool you have is really a list of tools that we will call
resolution mechanics. The list of resolution mechanics, roughly in
increasing order of length and difficulty, is as follows: no roll
needed, single roll, aspect needed to roll, challenge, contest,
conflict, session, scenario, story arc. If something a player is trying
to do is too easy with a single roll, just use the next appropriate
resolution mechanic. Maybe I'll let Rad transform a goblin into a blue
whale, but he's going to have to spend a whole scenario making
preparations for such a massive spell. The goblin can even oppose some
skill rolls along the course of the scenario, if it makes sense in the
narrative. Feel free to use a combination of resolution mechanics and
other options as well.

### Potency

This magic system is designed to be used by some or all of the player
characters (PCs) in your party, so magic spells should require roughly
the same amount of effort as non-magical actions that produce similar
outcomes. That is to say that, if Rad and another non-magical character
are both trying to reach the top of a cliff, they can both roll
[[Athletics]] against the same difficulty to reach the top. If Rad succeeds
and knows the Air discipline, he can then narrate himself creating a
gust of air to throw him to the top, while the other character may have
climbed the cliff face.

You can scale this to larger actions using the tools listed above. Rad,
our dear Grumpy old wizard, may wish to wipe out an army with a single
fireball, but that is going to require a lot of preparation and
planning. If a mundane character were trying something similar, she
might try creating a landslide to wipe out an army. To do this, she
would have to find a place with potential for a landslide, get the army
next to it somehow, trigger the earth to move, and then get the heck out
of there before she is crushed. Likewise, Rad would probably have to
take a session, or even a full scenario creating advantages and
completing challenges, to rain fire down from the heavens on an entire
army.

There is no exact science for this, but try to compare the magical
effects to mundane ones. A spell to mentally freeze another character in
place sounds simple enough, but it is similar to a non-magic user
causing paralysis. Taking complete control of another character removes
their player agency and isn't very fun for that player. With that in
mind, a spell like that might make more sense as the goal of an entire
conflict than a single roll within one.

Some actions can be a little vague when dealing with magic as well. If
Rad wants to create a shield out of Energy, one could easily ask what
exactly that shield does. If the shield is just an aspect that can be
invoked on defense rolls, this can have a fairly low difficulty. If it
provides full cover, requiring it to be overcome before the enemies can
attack him, this would be a little more challenging. If Rad is also able
to shoot his enemies through the shield while remaining in full cover,
this will be even more difficult. Scale the difficulty of a spell based
on the effects it has. Some more examples of potency can be found in the
magic discipline descriptions as well.

# Special Situations

## Opposing a Spell

You can oppose spells in the same ways that you can oppose any other
action in Fate. For spells that are not hostile---an enemy teleporting
to safety, or healing themselves---any other spellcaster can use magic
to provide active opposition, if they are within a zone of the spell
being cast and can narratively justify it. Additionally, any character
can provide active opposition, if they can justify making a spell more
difficult to cast.

To defend against a hostile spell in place of the target, handle this as
stated in [Fate
Core](https://fate-core/conflicts/index.html#the-exchange). If you choose
to defend for someone else, any negative effects of failing or tying are
now placed on you instead of the target.

## Borrowing a Magic Discipline

There may be times that you wish to use a magic discipline that you
don't have. Maybe your studies touched upon the discipline, or you have
seen it used by others. In those cases, you can either wait until you
reach a milestone to buy the discipline with your available refresh, or
you can spend a [[fate point]] to borrow the discipline for a single scene.
This allows you to use magic that you are not as skilled in, for a
price.

## Animated Creatures

Some magic users have been known to create mindless beings to do their
bidding. Getting a creation like this to aid them in what they're
already doing generally doesn't take much effort, but if a magic user
focuses, they can improve the construct's effectiveness or even act
through the construct itself.

At its simplest, created beings are represented by an aspect and nothing
more. If a construct takes an action that requires a roll, it is at
Mediocre (+0). If it takes a single point of stress, it is taken out and
removed from the scene.

When you create a creature, you are essentially creating an advantage.
So if Rad decides to create a fire elemental with the Fire discipline,
he can roll [[Provoke]] to focus the fire into a humanoid being. We'll give
the fire elemental the name of Scorch and write that on the notecard as
our aspect, with however many free invokes Rad received. Scorch can now
act in one of the following three ways, each exchange.

- Individual Action: You can have the creation act on its own, rolling
  its own skills. This does require your concentration though, and
  replaces the caster's turn with its own.
- Affect Multiple Targets: You can split the [[shift]]s of a roll among
  two targets, if you can justify the created being taking action on
  one of the targets. To do this, take the total roll and divide the
  amount of [[shift]]s among the targets. Each target defends
  individually.
- Teamwork Bonus: If the creature is able to help you or another
  character with an action and has the appropriate skill at Average
  (+1) or better (via the Animator stunt), it can give you a +1
  [teamwork bonus](https://fate-core/teamwork/index.html) to add to your
  roll.

## Enchanted Items

Many magic disciplines allow you to create advantages on items, to make
them more or less effective. Generally, these modifications will only
last for a scene or a session at most, but these effects can be made
permanent. It is very difficult to enchant an item, and it usually takes
a lot of time, resources, and sometimes collaboration. If the
protagonists are enchanting items, it would probably be in their "off
screen" time and will take some time to complete. Most of the time,
though, they should be running into enchanted items as gifts, rewards,
or forgotten loot. These items can be represented using the "[Fate
Fractal](https://fate-core/extras/index.html#the-bronze-rule-aka-the-fate-fractal)".
270): "In Fate, you can treat anything in the game world like it's a
character. Anything can have aspects, skills, stunts, stress tracks, and
consequences if you need it to."

The most useful tools for creating enchanted items are aspects, stunts,
and stress tracks. Aspects show story significance and allow for invokes
and compels. An item can require a character aspect slot, or it can have
a flaw aspect, such as: Cursed blade, Useless against blunt objects,
etc.

Stunts allow an item to show its mechanical benefits on a consistent
basis. Items with stunts can either require one refresh per stunt, or
each stunt can be activated for the rest of the current session by
spending a [[fate point]].

Lastly, stress tracks allow you to limit the uses of an item. Items with
stress tracks generally don't require a flaw or refresh, as the limit
is usually enough of a hindrance. Give the item as many stress boxes as
you see fit. Each time it is used, check off one stress box. When the
item has no more available stress, it is depleted.

## Alchemy

Unlike enchanted items, magical potions are much easier to create
because the magic can be cooked right into the liquid. An alchemist can
make potions with magical effects from any of the magic disciplines,
provided she has at least 10 minutes (depending on the desired effect)
to prepare it and the proper ingredients. This too can be handled as a
[[create advantage]] roll.

### Dragontongue

(Cost: 1 refresh/[[fate point]])

Forged with the searing breath of a trapped dragon, the blade of this
weapon is forever scalding hot. When you succeed with style on an attack
against a target covered in fur or wearing a flammable material, you may
choose to create the aspect On Fire, with one free invoke, instead of a
boost.

### Potion of Plant Elemental

(Cost: none)

[Pour this potion on a bush or ]sappling[ to automatically create the advantage Plant Elemental. The plant uproots
itself from the ground and will follow its creator's commands as best
as it can. It gains either one skill at Average (+1) and a one-point stress box or a free  #TODO
invoke.

# Disciplines & Stunts

## Magic Disciplines

Magic Disciplines represent the fields of magic that you have trained in
or have abilities in. The first discipline you take is free. After that,
each discipline costs one refresh. Disciplines function much like stunts
in this way. The difference is that they give your character narrative
permission to use magic in new ways. These are designed to be very
freeform, but you can only use the types of magic within the disciplines
your character has taken on. The examples used in each description are
not exhaustive and are provided as guidelines rather than rules.

### Air

You have mastered control over the air. This discipline allows you to
fly for short bursts ([[Athletics]]), push and pull the air ([[Physique]]/casting skill), and even attack with it ([[Shoot]]). You can
[[create advantage]] to allow yourself or someone else to fly for longer
periods of time (casting skill). The difficulty for creating an
advantage to allow flight should be around Fantastic (+6). You can also
animate the air into a creature capable of following commands ([[Provoke]]),
starting at a Good (+3) difficulty.

### Death

You have mastered control over death and the dead. You can shoot blasts
of green necrotic energy ([[Shoot]]), weaken your enemies (casting skill),
and animate the dead ([[Provoke]]), starting at a Good (+3)
difficulty---although this doesn't quite make them "living" again.

### Earth

You have mastered control of stone and dirt. You can move earth ([[Physique]]), shape it ([[Crafts]]), and attack enemies at range ([[Shoot]]). You
can animate piles of rocks or dirt into a creature capable of following
commands ([[Provoke]]), starting at a Good (+3) difficulty.

### Energy

You have mastered the control of magical energy. You can manipulate
energy into various sparkling blue, translucent forms, like a key to
unlock a door ([[Burglary]]), a large hand to lift something out of your way ([[Physique]]), a shield for protection ([[Crafts]]), or a lightning bolt to
attack someone at range ([[Shoot]]). You can animate objects (excluding what
is covered by other disciplines)---such as armor, weapons, and
rugs---into a creature capable of following commands ([[Provoke]]), starting
at a Good (+3) difficulty.

### Fire

You have mastered the control of fire. You can create fire out of thin
air (casting skill) and use it to attack your enemies ([[Shoot]]). You can
animate fire into a creature capable of following commands ([[Provoke]]),
starting at a Good (+3) difficulty.

### Illusion

You have mastered control of what is seen. You can create convincing
illusions ([[Deceive]]) and even manipulate whether or not something is
visible at all ([[Stealth]]). You also have the ability to light up dark
areas (casting skill) and frighten your enemies with terrifying
projections ([[Provoke]]).

### Life

You have mastered the power of life force itself. With it, you can begin
the healing process on consequences (casting skill), create wards of
protection ([[Crafts]]), and even temporarily focus the energy into weapons ([[Crafts]]) and angelic beings ([[Provoke]]), starting at a Good (+3)
difficulty.

### Mind

You have mastered control of the mind. You have the ability to read
surface thoughts ([[Notice]]), deeper emotions and intentions ([[Empathy]]), and
place thoughts in the mind of a being ([[Provoke]]). You can also take
complete control of less-intelligent beings.

### Nature

You have mastered control over nature. You can grow plants from nothing (casting skill), grab enemies with vines and tree limbs ([[Physique]]), fire
thorns at a foe from range ([[Shoot]]), and secrete poisonous toxins ([[Lore]]).
You can animate and command plants to do your bidding ([[Provoke]]),
starting at a Good (+3) difficulty.

### Sight

You have mastered control over what you see and perceive. You can
uncover hidden secrets ([[Investigate]]) and discern illusions from reality ([[Empathy]]). You can also look or listen in on places, people, or objects
that you know well, no matter the distance (casting skill). These spells
should increase in difficulty due to a lack of familiarity with the
target and greater distances.

### Teleport

You have mastered the art of teleportation. You can teleport to a
location that you know well or can see ([[Athletics]]). Destinations that
are farther away and/or not as well known to the caster call for higher
difficulties. You can also teleport other beings and objects to your
location or a location near you ([[Provoke]]/casting skill) and open portals (casting skill).

### Transform

You have mastered the art of shapeshifting. You can transform yourself (casting skill) or another being ([[Provoke]]) into the form of another
creature or person that you are familiar with. This is a Create an
Advantage action. Transforming into creatures significantly smaller or
larger than the target make the spell much more difficult. Changing
portions of a target is easier than changing its whole self (i.e. - give
the target gills rather than turning it into a fish). You can also
transform objects, allowing you to mend them, weaken them, or alter
their shape.

### Water

You have mastered the control of water. You can create water out of thin
air (casting skill), create items and barriers out of ice ([[Crafts]]), or
throw blasts of water and ice at your enemies ([[Shoot]]). You can animate
water into a creature capable of following commands ([[Provoke]]), starting
at a Good (+3) difficulty.

## Magic Stunts

Below is a list of stunts relevant to this magic system. Some provide
added bonuses to the magic disciplines above, while others might be
taken by anyone. Each stunt below costs one point of refresh. This list
is meant to spark ideas and is not intended to be exhaustive.

- **Animator.** (Requires: Any discipline that allows animation) When
  you animate something, your animation now starts with one skill at
  Average (+1) and a 1-point stress box. You can also exchange any
  free invokes received for both a skill at Average (+1) and a 1-
  point stress box for your animated being. If an animated being has
  multiple skills at Average (+1), they can be combined to increase
  their power, as can stress boxes. So, if you exchange two free
  invokes, you can receive one Skill at Fair (+2) or two skills at
  Average (+1), along with one 2-point stress box or two 1- point
  stress boxes.
- **Animation Specialist.** (Requires: Animator) When you successfully
  animate something, gain an extra free invoke. This free invoke can
  be spent to improve the created creature, as stated in the Animator
  stunt.
- **Blast.** Once per session, you may attack everyone in a single
  zone with [[Shoot]]. Apply your roll to each target in the zone, and
  they can each defend individually.
- **Counterspell.** Once per session, you can force a single magical
  action to fail without a roll. This does not apply to rituals and
  spells that take time to cast.
- **Magical Backlash.** Once per session, you may deal yourself a
  consequence in exchange for a +4 on your roll, when performing a
  magical action.
- **Shapeshifter.** (Requires: Transform discipline) When you
  transform into another creature, you may choose a skill. All actions
  taken with that skill, while you remain in that form, now gain a +2.
- **Stress Reducer.** (Requires: Life discipline) Once per scene, you
  may deal two stress to yourself in order to clear a character's
  stress track of the same type (physical or mental).
