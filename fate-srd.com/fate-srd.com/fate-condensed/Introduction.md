[[Fate Condensed]]

# Introduction

This is [[Fate Condensed]], a version of [[Fate Core]] in as compact a form as we can manage. It is a complete roleplaying game; while other books might enhance your use of it, you don't need any other book to play.

On that note, let's get into what you _do_ need!

## What Do I Need to Play?

To play [[Fate Condensed]] you'll need two to six friends with one acting as Game Master (GM), some dice, some tokens, writing implements, paper, and something to write short notes on (_e.g.,_ small "sticky notes").

[[Fate Condensed]] uses **Fate Diceâ„¢** when characters take action. Fate dice are six-sided dice with two [0] sides, two [+] sides, and two [-] sides. One set of four dice will work fine, but one set per player is ideal. Other alternatives exist, such as using standard six-sided dice (1-2 = [-], 3-4 = [0], 5-6 = [+]), or the **[Deck of Fate](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/111835/Deck-of-Fate?affiliate_id=144937)**, which uses cards instead of dice. We use the word "roll" throughout the text for simplicity.

### For Veterans: Changes From [[Fate Core]]

Condensing the gist of a system from nearly 300 pages down to about 50 pages of text does lead to a few changes. As of this writing it has also been eight years since [[Fate Core]] was created, so a little iteration of the design is to be expected. In particular, we highlight the following:

- We've shifted over to [one-point stress boxes](../challenges-conflicts-and-contests/index.html#stress) to help reduce confusion.
- ["Balsera Style" initiative](../challenges-conflicts-and-contests/index.html#turn-order) (also known as "elective action order" or "popcorn initiative") is the default rather than using skills to determine turn order.
- [Advancement](../advancement/index.html) functions a little differently; we've eliminated significant milestones and finessed major ones (as breakthroughs) to compensate.
- We've removed the notion of active opposition as separate from the [defend action](../taking-action-rolling-dice/index.html#defend). This has a few minor ripple effects, particularly [overcome's tie result](../taking-action-rolling-dice/index.html#overcome).
- [Create an Advantage](../taking-action-rolling-dice/index.html#create-an-advantage) has been tweaked to offer better clarity and agency around the
  discovery of existing unknown aspects.
- [Full defense](../optional-rules/index.html#full-defense) is presented as optional and has been altered a bit to accommodate the expanded scope of the defend action. Other [standard rules options](../optional-rules/index.html) are presented as well.
