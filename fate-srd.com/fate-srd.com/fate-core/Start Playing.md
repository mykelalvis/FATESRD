[[Fate Core]]

# Start Playing

These are the basic things you need to know to play Fate. The following sections go into greater detail on everything covered above, and will show you how to get your game off the ground.

### Where To Go From Here

- The [Game Creation](../game-creation/index.html) chapter takes you through the process of setting up your game, so that should probably be your next stop. Then [Character Creation](../character-creation/index.html) will show you how to make the characters you'll play.
- Players, you'll eventually want to read [Actions and Outcomes](../actions-outcomes/index.html) and [The Long Game](../long-game/index.html), to help you get a better handle on the nuts and bolts of doing stuff and developing your character during play.
- GMs, you're going to want to familiarize yourselves with the whole book, but [Running the Game](../running-game/index.html) and [Scenes, Sessions, and Scenarios](../scenes-sessions-scenarios/index.html) are of particular importance to you.
