[[Fate Core]]

# [[Stealth]]

The [[Stealth]] skill allows you to avoid detection, both when hiding in place and trying to move about unseen. It pairs well with the [[Burglary]] skill.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: You can use [[Stealth]] to get past any situation that primarily depends on you not being seen. Sneaking past sentries and security, hiding from a pursuer, avoiding leaving evidence as you pass through a place, and any other such uses all fall under the purview of [[Stealth]].

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: You'll mainly use [[Stealth]] to create aspects on yourself, setting yourself in an ideal position for an attack or ambush in a conflict. That way, you can be [Well-Hidden] when the guards pass by and take advantage of that, or [Hard to Pin Down] if you're fighting in the dark.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: [[Stealth]] isn't used to make attacks.

[D][[Defend]]: You can use this to foil [[Notice]] attempts to pinpoint you or seek you out, as well as to try to throw off the scent of an [[Investigate]] attempt from someone trying to track you.

## [[Stealth]] Stunts

- **Face in the Crowd**. +2 to any [[Stealth]] roll to blend into a crowd. What a "crowd" means will depend on the environment---a subway station requires more people to be crowded than a small bar.
- **Ninja Vanish**. Once per scene, you can vanish while in plain sight by spending a [[fate point]], using a smoke pellet or other mysterious technique. This places the [Vanished] boost on you. While you're vanished, no one can attack or [[create advantage]] on you until after they've succeeded at an overcome roll with [[Notice]] to suss out where you went (basically meaning they have to give up an exchange to try). This aspect goes away as soon as you invoke it, or someone makes that overcome roll.
- **Slippery Target**. Provided you're in darkness or shadow, you can use [[Stealth]] to defend against [[Shoot]] attacks from enemies that are at least one zone away.
