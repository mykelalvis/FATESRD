# [[Provoke]]

[[Provoke]] is the skill about getting someone's dander up and eliciting negative emotional response from them---fear, anger, shame, etc. It's the "being a jerk" skill.

To use [[Provoke]], you need some kind of justification. That could come entirely from situation, or because you have an aspect that's appropriate, or because you've created an advantage with another skill (like [[Rapport]] or [[Deceive]]), or because you've assessed your target's aspects (see [[Empathy]]).

This skill requires that your target can feel emotions---robots and zombies typically can't be provoked.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: You can [[Provoke]] someone into doing what you want in a fit of emotional pique. You might intimidate them for information, piss them off so badly that they act out, or scare them into running away. This will often happen when you're going up against nameless NPCs or it isn't worthwhile to play out the particulars. Against PCs or important NPCs, you'll need to win a contest. They oppose with [[Will]].

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: You can create advantages representing momentary emotional states, like [Enraged], [Shocked], or [Hesitant]. Your target opposes with [[Will]].

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: You can make mental attacks with [[Provoke]], to do emotional harm to an opponent. Your relationship with the target and the circumstances you're in figure a great deal into whether or not you can use this action.

[D][[Defend]]: Being good at provoking others doesn't make you better at avoiding it yourself. You need [[Will]] for that.

## [[Provoke]] Stunts

- **Armor of Fear**. You can use [[Provoke]] to defend against [[Fight]] attacks, but only until the first time you're dealt stress in a conflict. You can make your opponents hesitate to attack, but when someone shows them that you're only human your advantage disappears.
- **[[Provoke]] Violence**. When you [[create advantage]] on an opponent using [[Provoke]], you can use your free invocation to become the target of that character's next relevant action, drawing their attention away from another target.
- **Okay, Fine!** You can use [[Provoke]] in place of [[Empathy]] to learn a target's aspects, by bullying them until they reveal one to you. The target defends against this with [[Will]]. (If the GM thinks the aspect is particularly vulnerable to your hostile approach, you get a +2 bonus.)
