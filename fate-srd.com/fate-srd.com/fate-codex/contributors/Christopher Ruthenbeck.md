**Christopher Ruthenbeck** is an armchair game designer who likes to
tinker with any and every game he gets his hands on. What he does during
his working hours sounds a lot more fun and exciting than it really is,
so he concentrates on gaming in his "off hours." He likes to ramble
about games over on his blog
(`http://efpress.net](http://efpress.net/)), and can be found on the
Twitters, too
(`@EldritchFire](https://twitter.com/EldritchFire.html)). He currently
resides deep in the Heart of Texas with his wife, his favorite gaming
stores, and copious amounts of amazing vegan cooking.
