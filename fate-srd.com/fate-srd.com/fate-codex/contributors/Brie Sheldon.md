Daedalum A.P. projects _Clash_ and _Tabletop Blockbuster_, and for FASA
Games Inc.'s _1879_ line. Brie is a fan of cyberpunk (obvs.) and
fantasy, and spends an unreasonable amount of time hoping that George
Lucas won't remake _Willow_. She is also a writer for Gaming as Women,
Imaginary Funerals, and her own personal blog. She's a video, tabletop,
and board gamer and hopes to see you on the 'net, chummers.
