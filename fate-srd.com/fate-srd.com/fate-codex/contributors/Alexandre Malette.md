**Alexandre Malette** is a Canadian biotech student who should probably spend more time studying instead of tweaking RPG mechanics. When he isn't sleeping over a chemistry book or slinging dice with friends, he spends the rest of his time browsing Reddit or at a boring retail job. Although he hasn't yet worked on a major project in the realm of roleplaying games, he definitely plans to in the future.
