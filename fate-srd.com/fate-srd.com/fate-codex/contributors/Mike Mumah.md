**Mike Mumah** has worked for the better part of a decade as a roleplaying game illustrator. His work has appeared in such games as _Shadowrun_, _Rifts_, _Dead Reign_, _Part-Time Gods_, _Babylon 5_, and several others. The Michigan-based artist is currently at large from the Briarsbrook Institute for the Criminally Insane and considered extremely dangerous. If sighted, do not approach him! He may seem very affable and friendly but don't be fooled! Please call the authorities and delay him with free coffee, bourbon, and/or hot wings. He will take the time to enjoy this bait until he can be apprehended. This is for the public's best interest.
