**Jeremy Kostiew** is a technical designer by day and a graphic-doer,
sorta-writer by night. He's done art for Growling Door Games, Machine
Age Productions, Zero Point Information, and the Indie Game Developer
Network. He has written for Machine Age Productions' Fate-powered _ADX_
and Onyx Path's _Werewolf: the Apocalypse_. He has the highest tolerance
for spicy food out of any human being alive, possibly due to some kind
of dragon blood. Dude loves werewolves and gnolls because they are
obviously the best monsters ever.
