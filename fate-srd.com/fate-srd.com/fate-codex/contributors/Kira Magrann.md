**Kira Magrann** is an artist, game designer, and queer feminist living in Columbus, Ohio. She organizes Indie Games on Demand at Origins and Gen Con and designed the fetishistic car game _Crash Into You_. An advocate for weird, sexy, and queer RPGs and LARPs, her tastes in gaming tend toward the conceptual and contemporary. She's also working on many fronts to help build more inclusive and diverse spaces in gaming for all genders, sexualities, and races.
