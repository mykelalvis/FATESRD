**Jiima Arunsone** has been role-playing for about two decades as a game master, LARP director, and a driving force behind a few local conventions in a long-forgotten past. Published a scenario once, but everyone forgot what it was about. A die-hard fan of Star Wars, zombies, magical girls anime, ponies, and computers (don't ask). Working in spare time on some weird settings, but spare time is a rarity when you're a parent. Lives in Warsaw, Poland.
