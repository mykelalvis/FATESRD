**Jon Peacock** is a mild-mannered IT guy by day and a daydreamer by
night (he assures us this is possible). He has recently started trying
to get these dreams out of his head on to paper with varying degrees of
success, most of which can be found at <https://khellmg.wordpress.com/>.
Family Matters is his first published work.
