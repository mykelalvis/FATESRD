**Travis Scott** is a teacher, social worker, art historian, game maker,
and game player. His RPG work can be found through any number of
clandestine networks accessible at the loneliest corners of the social
media darknet, if you know the appropriate passphrases, URLs, and proxy
agents. He writes about chickens in postmodernity, draws maps, and
thinks more about dragons than anyone ever has.
