**Don Bisdorf** tells stories through fiction and roleplaying, having detoured briefly through video game programming and webcomics. He is the author of the Fate Adventures & Worlds setting Sails Full of Stars, and a self-published fantasy novel titled Stone of Names. He has more Fate projects in progress and will almost certainly brag about them at <http://donbisdorf.blogspot.com/>.
