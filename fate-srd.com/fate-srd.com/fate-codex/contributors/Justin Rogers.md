**Justin Rogers** has had an uncommon introduction to RPGs---he's played five or six different Apocalypse World hacks and a bunch of Fate, but doesn't really have any idea what "a Pathfinder" is. He works sporadically on various projects: a Baltimore city guide for _Urban Shadows_, his analytics-oriented sports blog ([thesplog.com](http://thesplog.com/)), songs for his barely-existent rock band Kodiak Arrest, and his astrophysics Ph.D. thesis, though not necessarily in that order.
