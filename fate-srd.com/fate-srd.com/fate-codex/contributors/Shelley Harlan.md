**Shelley Harlan** is an editor by day and by night ... is also an
editor, because you can't get too much of a good thing. She works for
the the indie RPG company Faster Monkey Games and still can't quite get
used to the idea that people will pay her money to read gaming material.
She also thinks it's a fun game to see if you can spot the typo in this
bio.
