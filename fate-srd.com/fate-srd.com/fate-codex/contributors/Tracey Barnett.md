Found one day on the side of a lonely road, clutching a broken laptop and a battered copy of the 2nd Edition DMG, **Tracy Barnett** writes and devlopes as one half of Exploding Rogue Studios. Tracy's first game, _School Daze_, won a Judge's Spotlight ENnie in 2013. In 2014, Tracy pioneered the Swedish Duck school of martial arts training, quickly adopted by the Secret Global Police.

There is no such thing as the Secret Global Police.
