**Nick Bate** is a galactic archaeologist, which he swears is an actual
thing. When he's not mapping dwarf galaxies, Nick draws stick figure
comics, builds Lego robots, and reads just about anything. He has
written an adventure scenario for the Fate-powered game Bulldogs! called
Ghost Pirates of the Bandeth Sector, which you should totally try out.
You can find him on twitter at

rather be playing something science fictional.
