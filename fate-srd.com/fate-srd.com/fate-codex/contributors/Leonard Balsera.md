**Leonard Balsera** is the lead designer of [[Fate Core]]. He has been working on the Fate system in one incarnation or another since 2003. He has not yet won the Diana Jones Award because of Jason Morningstar. Currently, Leonard lives and works in Austin, TX, as [[Brian Engard]]'s lord and master at Steve Jackson Games. You may find him on Twitter at [@leonardbalsera](https://twitter.com/leonardbalsera.html), a screen name that betrays his lack of perspective on the emergent consequences of character limits.
