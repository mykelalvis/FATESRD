**Ryan Macklin** is a human who likes to make and play games. He was one of the principal architects in The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game and [[Fate Core]] System, and has written for and edited dozens of books from various game publishers and independent authors. Ryan also collects shot glasses, drinks way too much coffee, dances in the kitchen like no one’s watching, and makes cool stuff with his fiancée, Lillian Cohen-Moore. He’s mouthy on the Internet: you can find him on Twitter ([@RyanMacklin](https://twitter.com/ryanmacklin)), G+ ([+RyanMacklin](https://plus.google.com/+RyanMacklin/posts)), and his blog at [RyanMacklin.com](http://ryanmacklin.com/). If you like stabbing gods in the face, maybe you would like his free game, Mythender ([MythenderRPG.com](http://mythenderrpg.com/)). Do a little dance, make a little love, get down tonight, get down tonight.
