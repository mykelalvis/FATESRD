**John Large** picked up his first roleplaying book in his early teens and, like many people back then, ended up being the GM because he had the books and no one else wanted to do it. He publishes Red Dice Diaries on YouTube, which has over 100 videos of actual play streams, GM advice, and player tips. Keenly interested in ancient myths and religions, John has many bookshelves creaking with works on mythology and civilizations from round the world. An avid fan of the Fate system, John enjoys the flexibility of the game system and the ease with which it allows ideas to be transferred from the GM's mind to the tabletop.
