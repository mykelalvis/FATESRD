# Infiltration: Cracking the House

_by Phil Lewis_

_**CrimeWorld**_ by John Rogers in _Fate Worlds Volume Two: Worlds in
Shadow_ provides an excellent rundown on how to run criminal exploits
using Fate. This article presents an alternative for breaking into a low
technology facility, focusing on a set of extensions to the challenge
rules (page 147 in [[Fate Core]]). These mechanics simulate the sort of
exploits made popular by video games like Thief and Assassin's Creed.

## The House

The first step in creating a scenario is to come up with details for the
**House**. The House is the target of the illicit activities. It could
be the king's secret vaults or the tower of a reclusive wizard. The GM
should think up a few interesting details about the House, including
what physical security and access restrictions are present. Avoid
creating a map, as that will be done collaboratively (see "The Heist").

### Security Level

The House has one skill, **Security**, reflecting how difficult it is to
break into the target. This value uses the same scale as Fate skills. A
target with Good Security (+3) might be the manor of a rural duke, while
Epic Security (+7) is appropriate for the king's prized emerald. If the
Security level is higher than the characters' peak skill, it's going to
be difficult for them to succeed.

### Guards

After creating the House, it's time to make some guards to watch over
the place. A mage might use imps or zombies to guard his books of
magical lore, while a king or mayor might employ more mundane defenses.

Guards are similar to mobs (page 216 in [[Fate Core]]), with a skill cap
equal to the Security of the House. The best skills for guards are [[Fight]]
and [[Athletics]] to defend themselves with as well as [[Notice]] and [[Empathy]] to
detect intruders. If you want to push the action toward stealth and fast
talking, give the guards higher [[Fight]] and [[Athletics]] skills; the player
characters will want to avoid overt aggression because it will be much
riskier.

Guards have one minor consequence instead of a stress track. In
isolation, guards are fairly weak and pretty easy to ambush. However,
there's an infinite supply of guards, so taking one out is essentially
just an effective, although risky, way to buy time. Finally, give the
guards a couple aspects, such as [Enthusiastic About Inflicting
Pain] or ["Is It Lunchtime Yet?"].

## The Plan

During play, the players don their black hats and **case the House**.
This involves uncovering some of the details already in place. What is
the ruby locked up in? Who has access to the king's chambers? These
questions can be answered using simple skill rolls.

As befits Fate, this can be a collaborative effort. If a player has a
good idea when asking a question about the mission, it's fine to run
with it, even---maybe especially---if it's a somewhat surprising
development!

### Supplies

In order to play through the mission, some note cards and tokens to
represent characters and guards are necessary.

### Writing the Plan

After the players have gathered details about the House, they have to
create **the plan** for the heist. This is a series of specific
**tasks** that must be overcome in order to succeed. If all the tasks
are completed, and the characters can get out without being detected,
they are successful! Create one task for each player in the game.

Tasks can be contingent on each other, or some can be performed
simultaneously. Be careful, though, that no part of the plan is optional
for success. Here are some possible tasks:

- Climb over the back wall

- Distract Baron von Schlefwitz

- Steal the key to the map room

- Crack the central vault

Above the description of the task, write a location where this task will
take place, similar to labeling zones in a conflict ("Main Office:
Distract Baron von Schlefwitz"). Each of these tasks gets an opposition
value that's revealed when a character enters the zone on which it's
placed (see "Character Actions: Movement").

## The Heist

Gather together the task note cards, and add note cards equal to the
number of players, resulting in twice as many note cards as players.
These are your zones.

First, place the note card containing the final task on the table. The
GM and players alternate placing the remaining note cards adjacent to
one or more of the existing note cards, thus creating a map of zones.
Label the blank zone cards with evocative names reflecting places within
the House such as _**Main Hall**_ or _**Barracks**_.

A number of zones equal to half the number of players rounded down have
**alarms**. Add labels to those cards such as "Alarm Bell" or "Summoning
Circle." Put the alarms on zones that don't already have a task.
Finally, add a zone for "Outside the House" and place it adjacent to one
or more zones that make sense.

Place all the characters in the "Outside the House" zone. Place guards
equal to half the number of players (round down) on zones of the GM's
choice. Place each guard near one of the edges of the notecard.

### Exchange

1. _Each character may take one action, in any order desired by the
   players._
2. All guards take one action, in any order desired by the GM.
3. The House takes an action.

### Character Actions

Characters have the usual actions, with others listed below. If a PC
fails any action while guards are in the same zone as the character, the
guards in the zone are **alerted**---they get the [Alerted!]
aspect which, unlike most aspects, has two free invokes.

#### Movement

Movement works the same as it does in Conflicts (page 169 in [[Fate Core]]).
When a character moves into a zone that contains a task, determine the
opposition value by rolling Security for the House. Write this result
next to the task.

#### Overcome Task

As an overcome action, use a thematically appropriate skill to complete
a task in the same zone.

If the roll is failed, the character takes stress equal to the roll's
difference. Whether this is physical or mental stress depends on the
task attempted; consequences taken should be appropriate to the task.

Furthermore, a failed or tied roll to overcome a task results in the
nearest guard becoming suspicious. Give the guard the
[Suspicious] aspect with one free invoke. If guards are in the
same zone, they become alerted instead.

#### Remove Suspicion and Alerts

Characters may attempt to remove the [Suspicious] and
[Alerted!] aspects using an overcome action opposed by the
guards. Failing to remove suspicion causes the guard to become alerted.

#### Attack Guards

Guards who are physically attacked become alerted, if they weren't
already. Guards who are killed need to be disposed of in some fashion,
as guards who stumble upon a body are immediately alerted.

### Guard Actions

#### Movement

Guards patrol each turn by moving one---and only one---zone, heading in
one direction, moving through adjacent zones, until they must turn
around and head back in the other direction. Use the edges of the note
cards to remember which direction the guards are moving.

Guards that are suspicious or alerted stop patrolling and use the same
movement rules that other characters do. Alerted guards that move onto a
zone with an alarm may sound the alarm, allowing more guards to arrive.
Alerted guards outside the House may also sound the alarm.

#### Overcome

A guard may use an appropriate skill, such as [[Notice]] (if a character is
using [[Stealth]] to hide) or Wits (if a character is trying to [[Deceive]] the
guard), to target a character in the same zone. If the guard is
successful, they become alerted.

#### Attack

Only alerted guards may attack.

### House Actions

Each turn, if there are fewer guards in the House than the number of
players, the Security of the House may be used to gain more guards. Roll
Security against an opposition of five. On a success or tie, one guard
may be placed on the edge of a note card anywhere within the House.
Since you start the heist with half as many guards as players, the GM
can summon guards on most turns at the beginning.

If the alarm has been sounded, don't roll. Instead, place one guard,
ignoring the limit for the number of players.

## Applicable Skills and Stunts

Characters may use [[Burglary]] to disable an alarm, thus making it more
difficult to sound the alarm. If successful, remove the alarm label. The
opposition is equal to the Security of the House.

Leading up to the heist, characters may [[create advantage]] (maybe using
[[Rapport]] to get a job within the House) that gives them authority to be
in one or two of the zones. Guards can't actively target the character
in such zones.

[[Deceive]] or some other reasonable skill can be used to hide a guard's
body so it isn't found.

## Concede

So, you're not going to overcome all the tasks and get out again? It's
fine to offer up concessions as in a Conflict (page 167 [[Fate Core]]). A
particularly good one is to let someone get captured in exchange for
other characters escaping. Time to infiltrate the jail!
