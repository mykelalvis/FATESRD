# Adding Reality to your Fantasy

_by Nicole Winchester and Cheyenne Rae Grimes_

> Stop thinking like a normal human with empathy and compassion...and start exploiting people's private lives, human faults, and intense emotions for ratings and personal gain. Congratulations! You've just become a reality TV producer! Your players are your cast, and you need a good story out of them to keep your job---one way or another.

In this article, we'll show you how to build a [[Fate Core]] game set in a
reality TV show, both behind the scenes and on-screen. We'll detail
special mechanics that replicate the most common features of reality
shows, including "ratings" stress, reality-specific skills, and
everything else you need to play through a full "season" of trashy
television. Enjoy immersing yourself in the on-set drama and high stakes
of reality television production without the messy business of starving
on a desert island or cooking in a kitchen with an abusive head chef.

## Creating Your Show

In order to bring reality TV to your Fate game, start by creating the
show itself as if it were a character with aspects, stress tracks, and a
name.

### Reality Television

Reality is favored in television production because it's cheap to
produce and hugely popular due to its "anything can happen" reputation.
In truth, reality of all kinds is predictable---there will be
interpersonal drama, fighting, tears, backstabbing, and train wreck
moments whether you're watching a competition show or following the
weekly life of an average family. Reality shows have a regimented
structure, five "acts" that always have the same challenges, the same
roadblocks, the same cooking tasks, and the same highs and lows at
roughly the same times.

#### Choosing a Genre

When you initially get together with your players, discuss the reality
shows you love and the reality shows you love to hate. What shows or
genres would you like to play in? What is it about them that makes them
compelling? Once you settle on a type of show you'd like to use, decide
if the concept seems interesting enough to the group to play on its own,
or if you need a twist, like placing it in the past or future, or
drastically changing the setting. Ask questions to zero in on the points
of interest.

For example, if your group was interested in playing _Big Brother_ on a
space station, what do they find _most_ interesting about being trapped
with a bunch of fame-hungry people in space? The chance of technology
going wrong? Aliens and humans trying to socially interact? Zero-gravity
challenges? Losers getting airlocked? _Why_ is it an exciting setting to
play in? Take notes, as they will be helpful in creating aspects, and
for ideas for future sessions.

#### Crafting Reality Events

After you've chosen an idea for your reality show, discuss what events
need to happen in every episode you play. Are there important
competitions, ceremonies, or challenges that come up before the end of
every episode? Are there scenes at "work," family dinners, or even
regular arguments?

Note a couple of things that happen every episode and prepare to
introduce those scenes when the opportunity arises. These scenes can be
on-camera or off-camera, depending on the needs and interests of your
group. ("Previously on..."s and character introductions are fine to
include if they're important to your show.) A Fate game of _Survivor_,
for example, would have a challenge and a tribal council every
"episode." It's up to the producer to determine the best time for each,
taking both time and dramatic impact into account.

### Show Aspects

You have a show! Give it a few aspects to bring it to life, starting
with a high concept and a trouble. Remember to reach for the stars!

#### High Concept

Your show's high concept should explain the essence of your show, why it
exists, or some combination of the two. This is the elevator pitch, the
quick recap that tells people why they should tune in every week.

> Examples: 
> - `Don't Wear That, Wear This
> - `Real People Become Fantasy Heroes
> - `Human Hamsters Trapped to Win Money
> - `19 People, 39 Days, 1 Survivor.

#### Trouble

There's always something about a reality show that critics can't stand,
recappers hate, or fans complain about. It's as if the show can't avoid
these pitfalls, no matter how many seasons it lasts.

> Examples: 
> - `Cast to Fail]
> - `Just a Little Mean]
> - `Too Much Drama]
> - `Cheesy]

### Ratings Stress

Shows are measured by ratings, so each reality show has a stress track
that measures ratings stress. When your show takes stress, you're losing
viewers, buzz, and interest, and you'll have to clear that stress to
climb back up the ratings board.

Shows start with three ratings stress boxes, and each box absorbs [[shift]]s
equal to its number. When a cast member fails a skill roll in Body,
[[Fight]], Gossip, [[Notice]], Party, [[Stealth]], or [[Will]] (as described below or
beginning on page 98 in [[Fate Core]] System), the show takes an amount of
stress equal to the number of [[shift]]s by which the character failed the
roll. The show clears the highest box of ratings stress at the end of
each session of play. When the show is "taken out," it is cancelled, at
which point the producer and cast work out the aftermath of being on a
briefly successful reality show.

#### Ratings Consequences

Like characters, each show has a -2, -4, and -6 slot, and taking show
consequences can help a show avoid ratings stress. Possible consequences
for a show could include a `Schedule Change],
`Pre-Emption] for a significant event, `No Network
Promotion], or a particularly `Brutal Review]. Mild
consequences clear after an episode, while moderate and severe
consequences will take several episodes to heal. The cast collectively
chooses whether or not to take consequences on their show and works with
the producer to define them appropriately. Show consequences heal at the
same rate as normal consequences; see pages 162-166 in [[Fate Core]] System
for more information.

### Show Names

Don't stress much over the naming of your show. The people who come up
with perfectly evocative show names have been doing it for a long time.
It's their job to be good at it---and even if they are, many show names
sound a bit ridiculous before you get used to them.

## Reality TV Mechanics

Although you can play reality TV stars in Fate with the traditional
aspect, skill, and stunt mechanics, these three mechanics replicate the
most fascinating features of reality TV to help producer and cast
recreate the genre. Feel free to use all or none of them, as fits your
show!

### Off-Camera vs. On-Camera

When the cast is on-camera, their every move can be edited, manipulated,
and broadcast to the world; when they're off-camera, they have some
small pretense of privacy, but the producers always have demands. It's
not long before the cast will try to take conflict off-camera to save
face...or turn the cameras on to catch their rivals in compromising
positions.

As the producer, you'll frame each scene as on-camera or off-camera when
it starts; however, players can use their [[fate point]]s to turn the
cameras on or off at moments they'd like to show to the world---or hide
from everyone.

#### Cameras On...or Off

Whenever cast members want to "flip" the cameras on or off, they must
spend a [[fate point]] to take control of the scene. Other cast members (or
the producer) can flip the cameras back, but they have to spend another
[[fate point]]! Turning the camera off can allow players to have private
conversations, discussions with production, or production meetings,
while turning the cameras on can let them catch each other in bad
behavior, arrange advantageous discussions, or set themselves up to look
good.

Reality shows are famous for hidden cameras that can to be turned on at
a moment's notice and camera crews on-call to shoot film at the drop of
a hat. Framing each scene as specifically on- or off-camera not only
provides the opportunity to put exciting moments and drama in the show
as they happen, but also gives the cast the chance to develop an
on-screen persona separate from their off-screen reality.

> Janet has deeply disliked Nate since day one of the show. During an
> off-camera scene where Nate confesses a deep, dark secret to another
> character, Janet spends her [[fate point]] to go "on-camera," so Nate's
> secret is broadcast to the world---and reframes the scene so she's
> been secretly listening in the whole time. She has ensured Nate's
> secret is now hot new gossip for the audience, and has information she
> can use against him.

### Reality TV Editing

This mechanic replicates the show's ability to manipulate recorded
events, editing them to appear differently. Editors have immense power
in their darkened suites, creating storylines or drama out of the
hundred-plus hours of tape they winnow down into one episode.

#### Editing for Drama

When on-camera, characters can spend a [[fate point]] to use reality TV
editing when they are trying to mislead other characters or mask
villainous deeds or embarrassing moments. Off-camera, editing can be
used to ensure a rival's worst tantrum makes it to air post-haste.
Producer and cast are encouraged to be as creative with editing as their
real-life counterparts---if there's a terrible unseen moment from the
past that would be dramatically appropriate to surface right now...maybe
that makes the best story.

> In an "on-camera" scene, Janet and Nate argue about Nate's secrets
> that Janet has exposed to others on the show. Though Janet professes
> her innocence sincerely, Nate would like the viewers to catch Janet in
> a lie. Nate spends a [[fate point]] to "edit" in a scene break, and the
> producer then narrarates a clip from an off-camera scene two sessions
> ago, where Janet tells another character Nate's secret. Janet is
> revealed as not only a gossip, but also a liar!

### Confessionals

This mechanic recreates one of the most compelling staples of the
reality genre---the direct-to-camera address in which cast members
reveal their dastardly tactics and darkest thoughts.

#### Forcing a Confessional

Confessional can be used once per character per game for free, while
[[fate point]]s can be spent for additional calls for confessional. The cast
members "in confessional" have a short scene with the producer at the
time the call is made in which they discuss the current situation, their
feelings and thoughts, and the other cast members, assuming the audience
is watching. The character calling for confessional then gains +2 to the
next action in a scene with the character "called in"---_related to what
was discussed in the confessional_. Confessional scenes can provide
excellent Milestone moments for characters, particularly in situations
of high drama or intense emotion.

> Nate has discovered Janet's lies, and he is infuriated that she has
> betrayed his trust. In the midst of a heated argument between them,
> another player breaks in to call for Janet's confessional, wanting to
> hear her real thoughts and motivations for exposing Nate's secrets. As
> Janet has not yet had a confessional in the session, a [[fate point]] is
> not necessary. The producer and Janet take a few minutes to discuss
> the situation and what she actually thinks before returning to the
> argument with Nate.

## Casting Your Show

Now that you've created your show and learned how to run it, it's time
for casting! Do you want to have a cast full of Type A personalities
that are bound to clash? Is everyone working together for the purpose of
creating a specific environment? Are the player characters only
housemates or can they also work on the production of the show?

### Character Aspects

For the most part, character generation is just like a regular [[Fate Core]]
game. Give each character a high concept and trouble as normal, focusing
on big and bold statements that will create drama and generate ratings!

After creating the first two aspects, leave the other character aspects
blank on each character. Everyone is a stranger! Through the course of
the first session, each player should add two more aspects: something
that defines their character on the show and a story from the past that
comes out in the first episode. Whether this story is true or not is up
to the player. However, if the story is false and ends up being exposed
as a lie, the character loses this aspect.

### Reality Show Skills

The skills available to each character are Body, [[Deceive]], [[Empathy]], Fame,
Fascinate, [[Fight]], Gossip, [[Notice]], Party, [[Provoke]], [[Rapport]], [[Stealth]],
Tears, and [[Will]]. Skills are to be chosen according to the traditional
skill pyramid, peaking at a Good (+3). Existing skills ([[Deceive]],
[[Empathy]], [[Fight]], [[Notice]], [[Provoke]], [[Rapport]], [[Stealth]], and [[Will]]) can be
found in [[Fate Core]] System on pages 97-127. New skills (Body, Fame,
Fascinate, Gossip, Party, and Tears) are presented here:

#### Body (replaces [[Physique]], [[Athletics]])

This skill encompasses all aspects of what your body can do. Everything
from what you are physically capable of doing to what you look like
doing it.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Using your looks to change a decision or someone's opinion
of you, showing your physical ability to be a true competitor.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Whether it's your ability to perform in a
physical challenge, win a beauty contest, or know how to look like you
can.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Physically attacking or lashing out at someone, tearing
someone's looks apart based on your own.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Use Body to defend against attacks against your physical
self or your looks.

#### Fame

This skill is all about who knows you and who you know. Many times,
reality TV shows will bring in (minor) celebrities to boost ratings.
Having access to trust funds, your parent's fame (or celebrity friends),
or being "internet famous" are wonderful assets.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Using your fame as an excuse, knowing the right people to
"pull some strings for you."

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Name-dropping famous people, catching people
off-guard with your big name charm.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Claiming to be more famous than other minor celebrities on
show, getting more airtime than others due to name recognition.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Deflecting attacks by rising above the petty problems of the
less famous.

#### Fascinate

This skill is for that certain _something_ that makes everyone want to
pay attention to you: from having an air of mystery to being so
magnetic, people just want to be around you. Fascinate is sure to keep
the focus on you and no one else.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Fascinate is not used to directly overcome obstacles.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Putting yourself in the middle of every
situation to make sure you have camera time, pulling focus from others.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: This skill is not used to attack.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Skillful contestants know that they can defend against
attacks on their character by soaking up the attention.

#### Gossip (replaces [[Lore]])

This skill is used to spread information. Rumors, first hand accounts,
hearsay, and information being passed off as the truth are vital parts
of getting face time. Having a wealth of knowledge about the other
contestants can be very useful. Just be careful of what dirt they have
on you....

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Gossip is not used to directly overcome obstacles.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Knowing when to speak up and when to lie.
Controlling the Gossip that floats around about yourself or others can
be downright deadly.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: This is the primary use of Gossip. Whether it's a lie or an
ugly truth, what people say about you can make or break a successful run
on a reality show. Keeping what you want known about someone a secret
can be a huge asset.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Placing blame on someone else or shifting focus onto the
wrongdoings of another contestant can be the easiest way to get yourself
out of hot water.

#### Party

This skill is about knowing how to be the center of attention. Being the
life of the party is a great way to become a ratings darling. Who
doesn't love a fun housemate? The ability to have a great time and cause
others to do the same could be your saving grace.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: With Party, you can smooth over hurt feelings by bringing
the fun. Diffusing tension could be the best way to keep friends, avoid
making enemies, and win the hearts of the viewers.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Bringing attention to your own fun-loving
personality, keeping the atmosphere in the house light and friendly, and
highlighting the achievements of your housemates by throwing them a
bitchin' party.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: This skill is not used for attack.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: This skill is not used for defense.

#### Tears

This skill is exactly as it sounds: being able to turn on the waterworks
on cue and using them as leverage.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Using your tears to change someone's decision, crying
during a made-up story about your past to convince the audience it's
legit.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Sobbing during any situation to gain sympathy,
crying to draw attention away from someone else.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: This skill is not used to attack.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Tears is really a defense mechanism in every social
situation; nothing keeps you out of the crosshairs like a few tears.

### Fate Points

Though reality shows don't have [[fate point]]s of their own, the characters
that work and star on reality shows can use [[fate point]]s to affect the
show through the use of the confessional and editing mechanics (see
above) and by invoking the show's aspects (as listed above). Characters
can also use [[fate point]]s to flip a scene from "on-camera" to
"off-camera" or vice versa (see "Off-Camera vs. On-Camera").

### Character Stress Track: Q Score

A **Q** **Score** is a metric that determines the familiarity and appeal
of a celebrity, TV show, property, or brand. In a reality TV game, Q
Score measures how much viewers love or love to hate the characters, and
it helps producers decide who to keep and who to fire. In addition to
physical and mental stress tracks, all reality cast members also add a Q
Score stress track to their sheet.

The Fame skill allows characters to take more stress boxes in Q Score,
like with [[Physique]] and [[Will]] for physical and mental stress tracks. Each
cast member starts with two stress boxes in Q Score; Average (+1) or
Fair (+2) Fame will give the character a 3-point box, while Good (+3) or
Great (+4) Fame will give the character a 3-point and a 4- point stress
box.

### Marking Q Score Stress

When cast members fail a [[Deceive]], [[Empathy]], Fame, Fascinate, [[Provoke]],
[[Rapport]], or Tears skill roll on-camera, they take an amount of stress
equal to the number of [[shift]]s by which they failed the roll. As always,
cast members can take consequences to avoid marking Q Score stress from
failed rolls. Q Score stress can be healed by succeeding with style in
one of the above skills _on-camera_---essentially in televised actions
that redeem the cast member in the public's eyes. Each success with
style clears the highest box of Q Score stress.

When cast members are taken out with Q Score stress, they choose one of
two options: pay double the cost for turning cameras on and off,
Editing, and Confessionals, or only participate in scenes framed as
"off-camera." Being taken out through Q Score means you're no longer in
the public consciousness---you're a nobody!

## Running a Season

Now it's time to bring your show to air! Have your notes at hand from
your initial discussions to keep what's most compelling to the cast in
mind, and use the show's basic structure to pace out the main events. In
the _Survivor_ example, the producer would aim for the challenge to come
in the middle of the episode and end the show with the tribal council.
If events on- or off-camera cause these to move around in different
episodes, so be it. The road of production never runs smoothly.

### Keep the Pace

Use the conventions of reality shows to provide a speedy pace to
"episodes." Keep them quick, self-contained, and to a set time
limit---try for an hour. Stop scenes mid-way to provide cliffhangers to
end the episode; frame scenes with specific parameters and aspects, as
they might end up on television post-editing; pause scenes to demand a
confessional from the cast! Playing multiple episodes per session will
provide a four to five hour session of gaming, but keep each scene
short, focused, and goal-oriented---even if that goal is to decide who
will be voted off the island.

### Keep It Fresh

As reality show seasons usually run twelve to twenty-four episodes with
a rotating cast, one season provides an option to play out a limited
campaign with a fixed number of sessions. In shows where characters are
"voted off the island," players can become part of the jury that awards
the prize, pick up an NPC rival as a new character, or some combination
of the two. Don't forget many competition shows include a twist where
eliminated players can return to the game! If the group is more
interested in an ongoing show, many shows go on for years with the same
cast living out their lives on camera. Others regularly implement
"All-Star" seasons or invite old players to return; reality "stars" from
one genre often move to another, or lead a whole new show during the
summer break...the possibilities are only as endless as "production
resources" and your group's interest and imagination.
