# Making Magic With Stress

_by Christopher Ruthenbeck_

[[Fate Core]] and Fate Accelerated Edition (FAE) are phenomenal games, but
chances are they don't always meet your needs. There are two existing
stress tracks for Core and one for FAE that are designed to fill a
specific need---and they do it extremely well. However, there are times
when your needs and their design don't mesh; when that happens, you get
to make your own stress track. [[Fate Core]] System does a decent job of
laying the groundwork for modifying your game, but while Extras (page
269) is all about fine tuning skills and stunts to do what you want,
there's not much about tuning the stress tracks. In this article, I
introduce a new mana stress track for magic users while walking through
the design process.

## A Brief Introduction to Stress

Stress is a much-used component of Fate, but it tends to get less
attention than skills, stunts, and aspects. Skills and stunts are very
easy for gamers to latch onto: 4 actions, 4 outcomes, and plenty of
design space to fiddle with it all. Aspects, too, are easily enough
understood: they're important facts about the character, scene, game
world, and so on. Stress, on the other hand, is this nebulous concept
that resembles hit points from other RPGs, and is commonly dismissed as
such. It's constantly used in conflicts to save your skin and out of
conflicts to succeed at a cost. It's always there, in the background,
making your character shine. But it can do so much more.

Both Core and FAE use the same basic mechanics for their stress tracks:
each box has a value from 2 to 4 (set right in the middle at 3 for FAE),
and when you check a box you use its value to reduce [[shift]]s of an
attack. Another way to look at it is this: _check a stress box to add
its value to your roll_. If you fail a defense roll by 2 and you check
your second stress box, you take no consequences and aren't taken out,
right? Effectively, it's a bonus to your roll.

Stress is a cost, sure, but it's one you choose to pay. When you fail a
roll, one option is to "get what you want at a serious cost" ([[Fate Core]]
System, page 132). For failed defense rolls, stress is that cost. If you
don't pay, you don't get what you want, and the aggressor gets what
_they_ want---which is usually to take you out!

## Extra Stress

For many Core games, the two existing stress tracks are sufficient.
Mental stress can be used to fuel Willpower-type abilities, and physical
stress can be used to represent pushing your body beyond its normal
capabilities. Since physical conflicts rarely attack the mental track
and vice versa, using one track to power abilities for the other's
conflicts can be a potent combination.

Because FAE only has one stress track, it's often better to make a new
track instead of drawing on the existing one. Fueling your abilities by
"double dipping" on the same track that prevents you from getting taken
out is a sure-fire way to get taken out very quickly!

### Mana, A Stress Example

A common fantasy trope is the wizard or sorcerer who uses magic to do
the impossible: Harry Dresden and Anita Blake from their self-titled
book series; Eragon the dragon rider from the Inheritance series; Merlin
from Arthurian myth; Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. We've heard of or
read about many of them or others like them: literary figures who can do
the impossible with mystic powers.

For some games, you want more than just the default stress tracks that
can be spent in the default manner. Sometimes you have extras ([[Fate Core]]
System, page 269) that need a little bit more oomph to them than just
skills and stunts. Stress tracks can fill the gap when neither skills
nor stunts are exactly what you want.

While skills are used to tackle problems head-on---hence the four
actions---and stunts make you better at your skills, stress tracks work
more as a modifier to your skills and stunts. It's a subtle change in
the focus of the skill or stunt, not always coming into play, but always
there to do its thing when needed. For example, your character is in a
foot chase and needs to make an overcome roll to jump over a low wall.
If you tie on the roll, you succeed with a minor cost. You and the GM
decide that cost to be a point of stress. You're still in the chase, but
you're that much closer to being taken out.

### Stress Backgrounds

The first step is creating a bit of background for the stress track. No
more than 3 or so sentences is needed, just something to get the idea of
what the track is used for and a place to draw inspiration later on if
you get stuck. For this step, keep in mind the Golden Rule of Fate:
"Decide what you're trying to accomplish first, then consult the rules
to help you do it" ([[Fate Core]] System, page 185). Since Fate is a
narrative-focused game, you want to start with the narrative first, then
move on to the mechanics.

### Track Length

There are many ways to determine the length of a stress track, and both
Core and FAE have one such way as their default. [[Fate Core]] uses the
skill-based stress track: you start with 2 boxes, and gain bonus boxes
for having a high skill. FAE utilizes the fixed-length track: it has a
set length of 3 boxes.

The skill-based track in Core is good for general-purpose stress tracks:
the better you are at something (i.e., higher skill), the more stress
you have to go along with that skill. Fixed-length tracks are good when
adding new stress tracks to FAE, since that matches up with the existing
stress track, but they can also be used for Core games where the
resource represented by the stress track is limited.

There are two other options for stress track length: aspect-based and
stunt-based. Aspect-based tracks are good for those you want to limit in
size: your character aspects are limited, so dedicating them to your
stress track says worlds about your character. The stunt-based track
favors specialized characters: the more stunts you have for your stress
track, the longer the stress track is.

The aspect-based stress track originated in the Fate System Toolkit
under the wealth stress track (page 69). It starts at 2 boxes, just like
the skill-based, but gains one bonus box for each aspect that references
why it should be longer. So both [Filthy Rich] and [Hoarded
Savings] can increase your wealth stress track.

The stunt-based stress track also starts at 2 boxes, and you gain 1
additional box per two stunts that are related to the stress track---and
note that these stunts don't actually have to draw on the stress track,
just be related to it.

If you're creating a new stress track for FAE, it's best to avoid
having your new stress track based off an approach since each approach
encapsulates so many different facets of your character. Therefore, FAE
stress tracks are best left to either fixed length, aspect-based, or
stunt-based. The example mana stress track is using the stunt-based
length, so it can be used for either Core or FAE.

The skill-based stress track has its own built-in length limit: you can
only have a skill rated so high, and the skill pyramid prevents you from
skyrocketing the skill too high, too fast. The aspect-based stress track
maxes out at 7 boxes since your character only gets 5 aspects. The
fixed-length track also has a built-in limit: it's one length, period.
For stunt-based tracks, however, you need to think about the maximum
length it can be. Even a starting character can use all 3 stunts and 2
refresh to have 5 total stunts dedicated to the stress track. That would
give your stress track a length of 4---and the next milestone could see
it rise to 5! Generally, 4-6 is a good maximum, unless you want the
characters to be extremely powerful; in that case, a maximum of 8, or
even no maximum at all might be called for.

Since more powerful mages are able to harness more mana, the mana stress
track is going to be stunt-based. It starts at 2 boxes, and is increased
by 1 for every two magic stunts the mage has. Powerful mages are able to
do wondrous things, but they must devote their lives to the craft. For
now, I will set a maximum length of 5 boxes.

## Spending Stress

Now that we know what our stress track is about and how long it's going
to be, the next step is figuring out what we can spend stress on. The
default stress tracks are used to succeed at a cost, but that's not the
only option. You could also use stress for a bonus to your roll, or in
lieu of [[fate point]]s. A good example of "stress as [[fate point]]s" is Brian
Engard's [Ammo Track from Fate Codex---Vol. 1 Issue
1](../lock-and-load-using-ammo-fate/index.html): spend an ammo stress to
reroll a [[Shoot]] roll with a gun.

There is a small but important difference between using stress to
succeed at a cost and using it for a bonus to your roll. They seem very
similar on the surface, but the end results can be very different. Say
you fail a roll by 1. If your stress track is a success at a cost,
checking any stress box means you're ok, you paid the cost. But if the
stress track is a bonus, you could mark off your 1-stress to turn that
failure into a tie---or check off the 4-stress box to succeed with
style!

Which one you use depends on the feel you're going for. To get a more
powerful, active use of something, use the roll bonus. If the stress
track is more defensive or reactive in nature---such as stress tracks
that show resilience, stamina, etc.---it should be used to succeed at a
cost. Making a new stress track is very much an art, not a science, and
this is one example of why. It's tempting to forego the succeed at a
cost method because adding bonuses to your rolls may seem more
advantageous, but keep in mind the purpose of the stress track. There's
no right way or wrong way to do it, though; just go with what feels
right. When in doubt, go back to the background write up for the stress
track and mine it for ideas.

Fate Accelerated Edition has a similar once per session stunt template
on page 32 that can easily be modified to cost stress instead of being
once per session. Of course, since Core and FAE are extremely
compatible, you can easily use the stunt options from Core in your FAE
game!

## Recovering Stress

After stress is spent, you need to recover it. The standard method is
that after a conflict, when you've had time to catch your breath, all
your stress goes away. It's easy and doesn't require any bookkeeping.
However, in some cases you may want to change how stress is recovered.
The ammo track mentioned earlier requires a resources roll, representing
buying more ammo, while the wealth track from the Fate System Toolkit
has its own special way of recovery. In brief, you need to find "money
parcels" as treasure or payment, and the rank of the parcel is the
amount of stress recovered.

The method you use to recover stress should be based on what is already
known about the stress track: what it represents and why it's there. If
you're trying to create a stress track for super heroes, you want it to
refresh more often so the heroes can be heroic more often! On the flip
side, for a gritty, power-comes-at-a-cost stress track where even the
most basic of spells are potent, there should be a commensurate cost to
recovering the stress.

Here's the mana stress track in all its glory.

### Mana

Mana is an ephemeral source of energy that mages learn to tap into for
power. It is easy to harness, but slow to recharge. With it, mages can
harness unimaginable power of destruction---and creation.

#### Gaining Mana

In order to have a mana stress track, you must have a high concept
dealing with your training or status as a mage. It starts at 2 boxes,
and you gain +1 box for every two magical stunts you take, to a maximum
of 5 boxes. Each mana stress has a value of 1.

#### Spending Mana

Mana stress can only be accessed via stunts that allow for its use. Any
stunt you create that would normally require a [[fate point]] can instead be
written to use one mana stress instead. For a stunt to count as a
magical stunt, it has to modify or enhance your spellcasting ability,
even if it doesn't cost a mana stress.

#### Recovering Mana

At the end of each scene, step back each point of mana stress. Erase
each spent stress box and check the box to its left. If it's the first
stress box, just erase it---that stress is now gone.

#### Sample Stunts

**Crushing Gravity Cages.** When you succeed with style when creating a
Gravity Snare or similar aspect, instead of the normal benefits of
succeeding with style you may cause a 2-stress hit.

**Fireball.** Take one mana stress to attack every target in a zone of
your choice ([[Fate Core]] System, page 207).

**Focused Blast.** Choose one of your magical attacks. Take one mana
stress to gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls using said attack spell.

**Green Thumb.** When you cast a spell to control the local plant life,
you gain a +2 to your [[create advantage]] roll.

**Magic Missile.** When attacking multiple targets and splitting your
[[shift]]s ([[Fate Core]] System, page 206) you get a +2 to your attack roll.

**Versatile Magic.** Once per scene, you may take one mana stress to
invoke your high concept as if you spent a [[fate point]]. +
