# Heel Heat

_by Eddy Webb_

When Justin stopped breathing in the middle of the ring, I knew I was in
trouble.

It was the main event: Justin Green against me for the ECPW Heavyweight
title. We had been battling for months in bingo halls and school
gymnasiums, at thirty bucks a match. Just when he'd get close to a win
over me, I'd snatch it away from him with some dirty trick, and the
crowd ate it up. Kids screamed at me and their parents threw popcorn
while I slumped to the back trying to remember if I had gas in my car.

"Heel heat" we called it: the more the crowd hates the bad guy, the more
they get behind the underdog, and the more they'll pay to see the next
match. I'm fantastic at getting people to hate me. That's why I was
billed as "Violent Victor Keyes" by Rainier Rousseau, the part-time
announcer and full-time owner of East Coast Pro Wrestling. In fact, I'm
so good at being hated, that last month, some old man in New Jersey hit
me in the face with a crutch.

Justin laughed at that one, but then, he laughed at everything after
he'd had a couple of pills. He was taking them after every show while we
were on the road. I never used them, and I said so, but he said it was
just to deal with the pain, just to make himself a little stronger, just
to get an edge in the ring. "We're contractors, Vic," he told me once.
"Ain't no one gonna look out for us but us. Not the bookers, not the
owners, nobody. You do what you gotta do."

"Where'd you get them?" I asked.

He laughed again. "I like you, Vic. But not that much."

That's how it was for months. We worked well together, and we watched
out for each other. But this was the blow off, the final match in the
feud where I drop the belt to Justin. Yukiko, the booker (though she
always told us to call her the "head writer"), decided that our match
would be in a steel cage, pin or escape to win. It was a classic,
something that played well both in Japan where she used to wrestle and
here in the States. I was making Justin look good before I let him win.
He'd earned it.

At the fifteen minute mark, Justin hit me with his signature finishing
move, a DDT he called The Stoplight. My vision blurred when my face hit
the mat. Justin rolled me over, and I barely managed to raise my
shoulder before the referee slapped the mat the third time.

Justin turned away, playing to the crowd as they cheered him on and I
got my head together. The ref came to check on me, and whispered in my
ear, "Finish, pin, reverse for three." He wanted me to nail Justin with
my finisher, a powerbomb the announcers had been calling the "Violent
Storm," before he reversed the move and pinned me for the win.

I nodded, wiped the sweat out of my eyes, and ran across the ring. I
grabbed Justin's arm and whipped Justin into the ropes, his face
smashing into the chain link fence around the edge of the ring. He
grabbed his chest and staggered, and I picked him up by his waist and
slammed him to the ground with the Violent Storm. The referee started
counting.

That's when I noticed Justin wasn't breathing.

The ref's hand started to come down for the third time. I pulled off of
Justin, leering at the crowd. "I'm not done with him yet!" I yelled. I
walked away, shoving the referee contemptuously. He knew the signal, and
checked on Justin. After a second, he came back to me and started
arguing, poking me in the chest before pointing to his own shirt to tell
me that I need to respect his authority.

Oh no. That meant Justin was badly hurt. Now I had to go against the
script and win the match.

I stormed past the referee and punched Justin in the face and neck,
hoping that would bring him around. When it didn't, I pulled him into
his own move, The Stoplight, and nailed him to the mat. The ref quickly
counted to three, and just like that I was still champion.

I got up and started talking trash, distracting the crowd while security
ran down to the ring to get Justin out of there. When my music started
to play and Rainier announced my win, I glanced over my shoulder, and
saw them propping Justin up to make it look like he was just groggy. I
snatched my belt from the referee and made my way through the curtain,
hot dog wrappers and curses bouncing off my back.

All of the workers were crammed into the tiny locker room, either trying
to rubberneck or pushing guys back to keep them from rubbernecking. I
shoved my way through the crowd and found Justin. He was laid out on one
of the benches in the locker room, where Yukiko was giving him CPR. I
dropped the belt on the floor and stared at Justin. Outside I could hear
Rainier thanking the crowd and shooing them out of the convention
center.

Then it was quiet, and I kept staring at Justin as Yukiko's arms got
tired. An ambulance came, and I watched them wheel Justin out of the
locker room. But I wasn't seeing any of it. I kept thinking about all
the pills Justin took, playing my responses over and over in my head as
I stared at the empty bench.

I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked over to see Yukiko there. "You
okay?" she asked.

"I don't think so," I said, looking down at the belt still on the floor.
"I carried that hunk of gold for months, and it didn't feel heavy until
I saw Justin like that."

"It wasn't your fault."

I ignored her and kept staring at the belt.

"You should probably go out the back, though," she continued. "There's
still some pissed-off true believers hanging around. They think you sent
their favorite to the hospital. If they do see you, you'll have to keep
kayfabe."

"Keep...?" I finally looked over at Yukiko. "You want me to stay in
character out there? To take credit for this?"

She took her hand off my shoulder, carefully, like I might explode. She
was right. "Maybe now's not the time...."

"You're right," I said, grabbing the belt off the floor. "This isn't the
time. I don't know how they did things in Japan, but we're not doing
this. I'm not going out there to brag about sending Justin to the
hospital until I know what happened out there. I don't give a damn about
the storyline. If you don't like it, take this damned belt right now."

"It's not up to me, Vic. Rainier says this is the most attention he's
gotten in months, and he wants to use it as momentum for the next few
shows. And you're brilliant at getting the crowd against you. This could
be huge. Maybe even get you some attention for the major feds."

I threw the belt on the bench. She rushed over and picked it up as I
stomped out of the locker room to look for Rainier. I found him outside,
standing on the delivery ramp, around the corner from the parking lot
where the fans were probably still lurking to get a piece of me. Ray was
smoking a cigarette, and arguing with a man in a track suit that I'd
never seen before.

I didn't care. I walked up to the two of them and launched into a
tirade. "What the hell, Ray? Someone got hurt at your event, and you're
already booking the next one with Yukiko?" My fists clenched at my side,
trembled.

The owner waved without looking at me. "Later, Vic," he said. His
French-Canadian accent always got worse after hours of trying to sound
American on the mic. "I'm in the middle of a business meeting."

"I don't care. We need to talk about what happened out there with
Justin."

"Exactly my concern," the man in the track suit sneered.

His accent said "Russian," and his finger tattoos said "Mob money
manager." I met a few guys like him when I spent some time upstate for
armed robbery. A buddy of mine tried to rob a convenience store, and put
the gun in my hands before he started beating the owner. The cops
arrived, and just like that, I was an accessory. I've tried hard to keep
that kind of trouble out of my life ever since.

I ignored the Russian, focusing on Rainier. "Ray, this is a huge
problem. I'm not just going to---"

Rainier pointed at me, dropping ash all over his shirt. "I don't think
you realize how big of a problem it really is."

I looked at the Russian. "I think I'm starting to."

The Russian shrugged. "I will leave you to your business," he said.
"Just remember, if any of this comes back on us, it will be more than
our money we come looking for."

He turned and walked off. I debated going after him, but decided against
it.

Rainier was still whining. "Look, just drop it, Vic."

"One of your workers is hurt, Ray. I was working with him when it
happened. I'm involved."

"Not hurt." He took another drag on his cigarette.

I waited for an answer, and when I didn't get one, my brain shut off.
The only word I could choke out was "Dead?"

Rainier nodded.

I swayed and leaned against the rough concrete wall. "He can't be dead.
He can't. I was just...."

"The police are on their way."

That snapped me back. "What are you going to tell them?"

He shrugged. "What can I tell them? You were locked in a steel cage with
him when he died. You and the referee are literally the only suspects."

"Suspects?" The gears in my brain finally started turning. "It was a
drug overdose."

"Maybe it was, but the cops are going to want to know where those drugs
came from, and the ECPW can't handle that exposure or expense. We're
barely keeping above water as it is. This was a..." He waved his hands
in the air. "...a personal matter."

I blinked. Something wasn't adding up. "We were at your show. We work
for you. And you know as much as I do that no one can keep a secret in
the back. You had to know about the drugs."

"You're _contractors_, Vic. If one of my contractors turns out to be a
violent ex-con, I have to cooperate with the police in their
investigation."

I suddenly realized I had raised my fist. Ray noticed it, too, and took
a step back, putting his hands up. "You don't want to do this. You'll
just make things worse."

"You son of a _bitch_," I snarled. "You were going to have me go out
there and claim credit for Justin's death."

"Only if everything was cleared up! He told me that it would keep the
police off my back." He tried to take another drag from the cigarette in
his trembling hands.

I took the cigarette out from between his fingers. "The Russian."

Rainier frowned. "Yeah. The Russian. I'm in deep, and they don't want
their drug operation coming back on them, you know? It's not just a
little jail time with those guys, and...."

I stopped listening. His shirt was in my hands, his eyes right in front
of mine, wide as saucers. "The Russians sold Justin the drugs?"

"Yeah. He said it was just a little something to give him an edge, you
know? I wasn't happy about it, but he made his own decisions. He's a
grown man."

"Was." I let him go, and he dropped to the concrete. "He _was_ a grown
man. Now he's dead, and you're ready to let me take the fall to save
your ass."

Rainier was trembling now. He must have seen something in my face that
he didn't like. If it was half as ugly as how I felt inside, I didn't
blame him. "Look, Vic. Don't even worry about the booking right now.
Just explain your side to the cops when they get here. Leave me and the
Russians out of your story, and maybe you'll only do a few months. You
keep your mouth shut, you get back out, and you come see me. I'll have
you back at the top in no time."

I walked away. He kept calling my name, but I didn't listen to him. I
couldn't let this go. I wasn't going to cover this up. Justin may have
been an ass, but he was my friend, and you watch out for each other in
the ring. So I'm going to find that Russian. I'm going to explain to him
what he did to Justin. And then I'm going to keep beating him until the
cops find me and pull me off of him. The Russian and all his friends who
sold him this poison are going to hate me.

And I'm fantastic at getting people to hate me.## "Violent" Victor Keyes
