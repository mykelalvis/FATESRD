# At What Cost

_by Mark Diaz Truman_

Over the past five years, a new style of indie game design based around
Apocalypse World has fueled a number of interesting designs like Dungeon
World, Monsterhearts, and Sagas of the Icelanders. Despite their
differences, all of these games operate with the same core mentality:
they reject preplanned "plots" for a "play to find out what happens"
ethos that prioritizes moment-to-moment conflicts that build over time.

As I've learned more about this style of gameplay, I've struggled to
express some sort of complementary mentality for Fate. Fate offers
something equally engaging, a playing style that hits an entirely
different set of buttons for my group and keeps us coming back for more,
but it's a style that requires the GM to put forward more traditional
plots and the players to prioritize the broader story over
moment-to-moment conflict. It's not playing to find out what happens at
all.

I propose that Fate works best when _we play to find out the costs_. We
know that success is all but guaranteed for the heroes, that they will
meet challenges and overcome them, but we are playing together to find
out what our heroes are willing to sacrifice, whether they are trying to
keep the world as it is or change it forever. Our heroes define the
costs they are willing to pay, and those costs, in turn, define our
heroes.

## Playing to Find Out What Happens

When Vincent Baker published Apocalypse World in 2010, he gave these
instructions to gamemasters (emphasis mine):

> **Play to find out: there's a certain discipline you need in order to
> `gamemaster for] Apocalypse World.** You have to commit yourself to
> the game's fiction's own internal logic and causality, driven by the
> players' characters. **You have to open yourself to caring what
> happens, but when it comes time to say what happens, you have to set
> what you hope for aside.**
>
> (Apocalypse World, page 108)

This blew my mind when I first read it. No planning out plots? No
scheduled twists or surprises? How would we have a story if we just
bumbled from one encounter to the next? It made no sense.

As I ran more Apocalypse World, I came to understand that the rules, the
characters, and the fictional setup all created situations for our group
without prompting; it was my job to represent the world to the players,
to give them an external logic they could bump up against when they
engaged the fiction. Their decisions---focused by the world I held
constant---added up to a story, albeit one we can only see in
retrospect.

### Apocalypse World-Style Fiction

I've realized that Vincent's clever turn of phrase describes more than
just a style of roleplaying games; _playing to find out what happens_ is
really the central tenant of a whole style of storytelling. It
encompasses shows like Lost and Breaking Bad, movies like Mad Max and
Pulp Fiction, and novels like the A Song of Ice and Fire series, The
Walking Dead, and pretty much anything by Stephen King.

In this style of fiction, the protagonists---not even necessarily
heroes---are vulnerable, physically and spiritually. Their world is
beset with troubles, no one is safe, and shocking revelations are a
regular occurrence. Characters die. Plots twist. And the story rolls on.
We stick around to find out what happens, to chase the fiction all the
way to the end of the road, no matter how ugly it gets. We don't worry
about what that story is until we see it in our rear-view mirror,
obvious to anyone looking backward but invisible to the characters
making decisions about the future.

### What About Everything Else?

But there's another type of fiction that works along a fundamentally
different axis, a kind of story in which I know precisely what's going
to happen...and I delight in the journey. Superhero fiction. Cop dramas.
Animated movies. A style of storytelling that looks a lot like the kind
of fiction created by Fate.

Think about movies like Iron Man, Die Hard, or Toy Story. Is there any
doubt that the heroes---and there are definitely heroes!---will triumph?
Are there really any unexpected deaths or earth-shattering twists that
radically [[shift]] the course of the fiction? Do we hang on for the ride to
see where the story goes or does _something else_ keep us grounded in
the story as it unfolds?

And if we aren't watching to find out _what happens_, why are we
watching?

## Playing to Find Out the Cost

I propose that the style of this fiction is concerned not with the
literal events of the story---the things that happen---but instead
emphasizes the costs of success. We want to know what our heroes are
willing to sacrifice to win, what they're willing to change about
themselves and the world in order to reach their goals. We know they
will overcome the villains, but we want---need!---to see them pay the
price to get there.

Take Sherlock Holmes, in any incarnation. We know that Sherlock Holmes
can solve every case; he's Sherlock Holmes, the world's greatest
detective! But we don't know what pains he'll bear, we don't know how
his relationships will change with the people around him, and we don't
know how the world will be different after he cracks the mystery. In
short, we don't know the costs of this case, both for him and for the
world at large.

When we start to gather up fiction that focuses on costs instead of what
happens, the list looks mighty familiar: superheroes, serialized crime
drama, military sci-fi, adventure-oriented fantasy, etc. It's the kind
of fiction that works great in Fate because it has vibrant, dramatic
characters who have an outsized impact on the setting. The characters
don't usually get stronger or more powerful as much as they become
different people, changing to meet the challenges rather than building
their power and influence over time.

### A Spectrum, Not a Binary

It can be tempting to view this distinction between these styles as a
dichotomy, but it's more like a spectrum. Some fiction that focuses on
what happens, like Lost or Battlestar Galactica, sometimes emphasizes
costs over uncertainty; characters like Jack Shepherd or Admiral Adama
are protected and sacred, shouldering costs and making choices without
ever really showing up on the chopping block. Conversely, even superhero
fiction can be written in a style that emphasizes moment-to-moment
conflicts and internal logic above the costs that the heroes pay to
succeed: Kick-Ass, Suicide Squad, and Age of Apocalypse all strike me as
stories about playing to find out what happens.

I'm not asserting that Fate can't tell stories that focus on events; I'm
saying that Fate works best when we acknowledge that the mechanics are
built to support playing to find out the costs. It's why Fate struggles
to handle horror---a genre built on the anxiety and uncertainty around
the events to come---and why long physical conflicts using Fate can be
boring and dull. When we focus on the uncertainty around what will
happen, like whether or not the heroes will win a single conflict, Fate
can drag. Focusing on the costs that the heroes are willing to pay,
knowing that they _are capable of paying those costs and succeeding_,
makes Fate work at the table.

## Using Costs in Fate

But how do we use this stuff? It's great to know that we're playing to
find out the costs that the heroes are willing to pay, but how does that
help us at the table? What does "playing to find out the costs" really
entail?

Above all else, this play style is a commitment to leaving a certain
kind of question open within the fiction: _we know that the heroes can
win, but what costs will they bear to succeed?_ As the GM, you must put
forward obstacles that demand sacrifice, pushing the characters both
mechanically and narratively, but you also have to be willing to let
them choose the costs of their success.

Fate games struggle when we let players pay costs cheaply. Cost is built
into Fate at every level---story questions, invokes and compels, stress
and consequences---but we too often let our players off easy to get to
the next event, the next outcome. How can you make costs count in ways
that build meaningful Fate fiction?

### Story Questions Costs

Playing to find out the costs starts by selecting story questions (Fate
Core System, page 232) that emphasize costs over outcomes. "What will it
cost the heroes to stop the villains who infiltrated the secret homeland
security program?" is a much better story question than "[[Will]] our heroes
stop the villains who infiltrated the secret homeland security program?"
The former question [[shift]]s every scene you set up away from _what will
happen_ to _the costs that the heroes will bear_. Nothing is free, not
even for heroes.

Since we're almost certain the heroes will stop the villains, giving
them an arena of cost---in this case, the fate of the secret
program---makes their choices much more clear. They might choose to
reveal the truth to the world, including exposing their own illicit
activity, or they might choose to root out the corruption without
toppling the program, risking an incomplete sweep. Either way, the costs
will snowball into a new set of conflicts, ripe with potential and
drama, based on their decisions.

Framing your story questions this way means that you can skip long
physical conflicts or mysteries that conceal information your players
will need. (If your players love this stuff, frame story questions that
point at those physical conflicts or concealed information.) Instead,
you should push them toward the choice points that matter:

- The heroes secure a copy of the program's secret files. [[Will]] they
  leak what they have to the internet?
- One of the heroes' friends appears to be working as a mole. [[Will]]
  they confront him or use his connections to learn more about the
  conspiracy?
- The villains are holding an ally hostage in a secure location. [[Will]]
  the heroes risk injury and pain to rescue them before the traitors
  kill the hostages?

Note that "Can the heroes defeat the biggest enforcer in a huge combat?"
is not a good story question. The answer is ultimately yes; the costs
are incidental because the heroes are eventually going to win. They
might tangle with the big bad a few times before bringing them
down---and might even lose one or two scraps---but almost no Fate GM is
going to kill off the characters if they fail. The heroes always get a
second shot, so there's no reason to fight to the death in any given
fight. Those aren't the stakes.

If you want to make a fight with the big bad interesting, you've got to
find a way to structure the conflict around costs that the heroes might
be willing to pay. For example: "[[Will]] the hero who refuses to kill
execute the villain? Or leave him to fight another day?" or "[[Will]] the
heroes prioritize stopping the villain or saving innocent people?" Only
then will the stakes of the combat feel real because there are real
costs that matter to the heroes in play.

### Invokes as Costs

The most common cost that heroes pay is [[fate point]]s. Since the players
have a limited number, each [[fate point]] spent is a declaration that a
player is willing to pay the price to succeed in this moment (or to fail
with a smaller margin). An invoke on an aspect is effectively a
narrative declaration that the hero is going to step up a bit---in a
particular way tied to their identity---in order to win the battle.

[[Fate Point]] costs can seem cheap and easy, but remember that a [[fate point]]
spent now is one that can't be spent later. Any time a player invokes an
aspect, they are saying, "Success now is worth more to me than success
later. I'm willing to pay real costs later in order to avoid paying any
real costs now." That's valuable information!

On one hand, invokes tell you what a player envisions as their
character's strengths and weaknesses. A legendary archer might spend
[[fate point]]s every time she shoots something with her bow, but turn down
opportunities to intimidate people; a mighty warrior might settle for
merely besting his foes by a [[shift]] or two in combat, but invoke an
aspect whenever he has a chance to play up his reputation. Take that
data and build story questions around it, asking how much those players
are willing to sacrifice when those strengths and weaknesses are called
into question.

The stakes of an invoke also point at useful information. [[Fate Point]]s
are used to declare the player's intent cheaply, but they indicate a
kind of early redline, a point at which the player is unwilling to
accept failure. If the archer spends [[fate point]]s to save a particular
NPC, then that's a place you can push on in the future. Is she willing
to pay more than just a few [[fate point]]s to keep that NPC safe?

### Compels as Costs

Compels are equally revealing. Whenever you offer a compel to a player,
you're asking them to pay a cost---usually narrative failure or
complications---in order to gain a resource for a later fight. In other
words, you're giving them a reverse loan: they can pay now in order to
have what they need when it counts.

But the compels they accept define their character more than they
realize. When a player accepts the [[fate point]], they are saying, "Yes, I
acknowledge that complication you're describing is inherent in my
character's story" and they are working that complication into the
gestalt they've built up thus far. Of course the heroic warrior has
enemies that want him dead; that's the _cost_ of gaining the kind of
reputation he's got.

Because these costs are as definitive as any failure, you've got to push
hard with your compels. The problem with "weak" compels isn't just that
they flood the system with [[fate point]]s; it's also that they fail to
define the characters. Let the players decide what costs to
bear---including when they turn down compels---but make them make a
_choice_. It's easy to accept a compel when all it does is merely
inconvenience you.### Undeniable Compels

Because compels have to mean something, I'm usually loath to offer a
compel when players don't have [[fate point]]s. It doesn't mean anything to
accept my compel when they don't have any other options. When a player
runs out of [[fate point]]s, I instead try to get them to take a
self-compel, revealing to me again what kinds of costs they envision as
inherent to their character's story.### Stress and Consequences as Cost

The most obvious cost, of course, is stress. But for the most part, it's
not an interesting cost at all. It's fictionless by default, a little
box your players check to avoid having to state something interesting
about their characters. Consequences, on the other hand, are narrative
gold, aspects that define "damage" in ways that further the story.

Thus, you have to distinguish conflicts that are designed to provide
meager opposition---like the security guards that stand in the way of
our heroes---from events that are designed to push characters toward
consequences. We do a disservice to the role that stress and
consequences have to play in the system when we mix up these two kinds
of conflicts, creating long combats when we need to push the story
forward or allowing the heroes to blow past the real antagonists without
batting an eye.

In the case of the meager opposition, small to medium mobs (Fate Core
System, pages 213-217) are the perfect opposition. If they use teamwork,
they hit hard enough to land a punch on the heroes, but they are soft
enough to go down without too much of a fight. The heroes get to show
off what they can do, but the villains don't distract us from the real
costs at work in the scenes ahead.

On the other hand, real antagonists need to push the heroes toward
consequences. Here are a few types that tend to work in Fate:

- **Glass Cannons:** A villain with a massive attack score, clever and
  tricky traps, or hordes of henchmen, and a weak defense can knock
  the heroes off their feet without feeling unfair or creating a drag
  on the story. These kinds of antagonists are doubly useful if they
  endanger bystanders or the environment in ways that occupy the
  heroes. Examples: Bullseye, HAL 9000, Hans Gruber.
- **Kryptonite Villains:** All heroes have blind spots and areas of
  weakness. Villains targeted directly at those weaknesses can push
  the heroes to their limits without shortchanging their strengths.
  Amoral antagonists, for example, often thwart the heroes by
  expanding the field of conflict in unexpected ways. Examples: Khan
  Noonien Singh, Scarecrow, T-1000.
- **"Friendly" Foes:** Antagonists who have emotional sway over the
  heroes can be devastating, especially when they are pursuing goals
  that are almost morally permissible. In these cases, the opposition
  is effectively a walking story question: will the heroes harm people
  they love to save the day? Examples: Darth Vader, Stinky Pete, The
  Winter Soldier.

Note that villains whose main schtick is taking a beating are _not_
interesting antagonists in Fate. It's fun to watch Neo destroy a million
Agent Smiths; it is much less fun for Neo's player to roll the dice and
spend [[fate point]]s until they are finally permitted to move through the
plot. Good villains inflict consequences in conflicts; the heroes have
to push through those consequences to get what they want.

#### Consequences That Snowball

In the end, you can judge consequences by what kinds of stories they
open up for the characters. A Broken Arm is a weak consequence...unless
the character who suffers it just happens to be the world's greatest
musician. For the average hero, broken arms are run-of-the-mill, the
kind of cost that gets hand waved in between sessions because it's not
much fun to be a superhero in a sling. But for the musician, it's a
crisis that requires her to find someone to cover for her while she
figures out what to do.

When you push your players to the point that they take a moderate or
severe consequence, push them even further. Work with them to create
emotional and mental consequences---Doubting the Mission or Can't Let My
Guard Down---that point toward the next session's conflicts. Make the
recovery a story unto itself, so that the cost they paid resonates.

## Cheap Costs Cheapen Everything

Like playing to find out what happens, playing to find out the costs
requires discipline. But instead of sticking to the strict logic of the
setting and characters, your job is to never back down from the costs.
Present them fairly. Be honest with your players. Let them know that
winning "no matter the cost" might change them. Push them to commit to
their own heroism and nobility in the face of massive obstacles. And
then drop that hammer when the time comes, demand they pay the toll, and
never look back.

We know what happens. We know they win. But what will they pay to get
there? That's up to them. Don't cheapen it by letting them off the hook
at the last minute. Play to find out the costs. +
