# Making Fate Points Matter

Why does this happen? They're not bad players. They're actually quite
good at coming up with aspects and interconnecting character stories;
during fights, they manage to play off one another's moves with an ease
that sometimes feels rehearsed, like they coordinate their combat
maneuvers when I'm out of the room. No, it isn't their fault that they
end up with a stack of chips during the non-fighting times in a game.
It's mine. As GM, I have a responsibility to make those points matter to
each player beyond something that can be stacked, arranged, or fiddled
with.

It's human nature in gaming to want to collect material during play.
Pass a certain square on the board and you'll receive colored bits of
paper. Correctly guess the number the little metal ball lands on and get
a pile of clay chips. Even if the collection doesn't have a physical
component---kill the monster and get experience points---we still like
collecting things.

You may notice a lot of talk about the [[fate point]] economy, but fate
points aren't money in the strictest economic sense; they can't get used
to pay for dinner. They aren't proof that someone is a good guesser or
even that someone defeated imaginary creatures with imaginary weapons.
What they are---and what the players don't realize when they stack the
chips up in front of them---is half of a commitment. They're the promise
of something awesome. So while hoarding them is the natural tendency,
the focus should be on spending them.

Because spending them is the other half of the commitment. By giving my
player a point, I'm promising them that they're going to get a moment to
have the spotlight and, very likely, praise from other players if what
they do is particularly awesome. They just have to meet me halfway and
take charge of the moment and be awesome.

The [[fate point]] is a reminder of that. Or at least it should be. The fate
point is well named: it speaks to the fate of the spender and makes a
point about what they are capable of doing. The players sitting at my
table WANT to be awesome. I want everyone to have a good time. Fate
points make this easy, assuming the players recognize that potential. So
let's talk about three different ways everyone can recognize and realize
that potential---as GM to player, as player to GM, and as player to
player.

## GM to Player

> The hunk, his girlfriend, the nerdy girl, their stoner buddy, and his
> dog---yes, we're pretty much playing Scooby-Doo---are sneaking around
> the creepy old mansion, trying to figure out if the ghost of Mr.
> Webster is real or not. They haven't split up yet, which means I
> haven't had the pleasure of springing a terrible trap on them. I know
> the hunk's girlfriend, Doris, has an aspect of [Trouble Finds Me More
> Than I Find It], so I casually pick up a chip and spin it
> between my fingers.
>
> "You know, Doris, this room has loads of bookshelves. High, tall,
> heavy-looking bookshelves."
>
> Doris knows what's coming.
>
> "And trouble finds you more than you find it, doesn't it?" I say.
>
> Doris takes a look at the one chip she already has and compares it to
> the stacks other players have. She reaches across the table and takes
> the chip out of my hand. "Yeah, it does, which is why I'm going to
> grab that book marked 'Building Your Own Secret Passages for Fun and
> Profit'."

By far this is the easiest of the three to bring up, because this
discussion comes up more often in play than any other. The GM has a list
of player aspects handy (or at least should. Seriously. Even if it's
just scrawled on a notecard) and when one of those aspects can change
the course of play---for good or ill---out comes the compel.

The GM has tremendous ability to incentivize action here. In the above
example, I didn't know which book would be a trigger, and I didn't even
know what it would be a trigger for, but I know my players, and I know
how canny and perceptive they can be. When you add up old house, big
library, and Scooby-Doo vibe, of course there's going to be a secret
passage. As GM, I don't need to script everything to the last detail,
because I trust my players to be able to create the experience they
want. I'm just there to keep their creations within the boundaries of
the setting and mechanics.

Little by little, in letting the players act, rather than just always
react to me, I'm encouraging them to go deeper into the world. And if
they feel encouraged to add details, even as small as a book title,
they'll stay hooked into the fiction we're creating.

Of course, that still doesn't address spending points. My giving them
out only means there are more poker chips sitting idle next to the corn
chips. As GM, I need to make them seductive, and that requires a little
manipulation on my part.

I can hold up the chip and describe one of the possible actions a player
can take.

> "What did you find while searching the kitchen?"

This tethers the possible action to the chip, and should show that the
actions are possible in trade. Then it only becomes a matter of one
player going first, and showing the others that there's value in using
rather than holding onto the points, and the table as a whole benefits
once the floodgates of actions-feeding-into-more-actions open and the
story accelerates.

Accelerating the story means that, ideally, chips are being trafficked
more. Aspects are coming into play to help inform actions and give
nuance and depth to the story. It's no longer my story alone; the story
belongs to the whole table, and when I hand out chips, it's a stock
paying dividends.### Bribing Players

Okay, yes, flashing [[fate point]]s while suggesting a course of action is
sort of like forcing action through bribery. The player might not have
naturally come up with wanting to search the kitchen; they might have
just gone on to another room or done something else.

And it's not what they find in the room that really matters---the point
here isn't to push them to discover something I already decided is in
the kitchen. What matters is that we're equalizing the story-telling
field: we're each providing details, which spares me the extra
on-the-fly fabrication and helps invest the players in what's going on.## Player to GM

Here's the reverse of my dispensing chips: players choosing to pay me.
And it's trickier to manage than when I'm handling the economy because
I'm not in control and because I'm trusting the players understand the
rules and mechanics well enough to take over and be awesome, even if
just for an action.

> Carrying a shovel she found in the shed, the nerdy girl, Margot, moves
> down the dark corridor. After some hesitant steps, she turns a corner
> to find the Big Scary Creature.
>
> The accompanying dice roll isn't that awful, but she's short of really
> smacking the Creature and buying herself some time to make good her
> escape. Margot's player hands over a chip.
>
> "I'd like to add +2 to my roll," she says. "Adrenaline surges kick in
> at just the right moment so the shovel comes down square in the
> Creature's midsection."

Theatrics aside, the best way to get players to hand over chips is by
giving them a good understanding of how the mechanics work. In-game
reminders, however gentle or meta, can be incredibly jarring for some
people, no matter how tempting they might be as quick prods. Skip them,
and focus more on good rules explanation up front, whether it's at the
beginning of every game, or just the first of the series.

A player handing over a chip isn't just doing their part in the
mechanics of the game; it's an admission that they've bought into the
story, and they want something to happen. This anticipation, this want
for cool stuff, isn't instantly generated. It doesn't just appear
because you've passed out note cards and the fate dice. It needs to be
cultivated by the story you're telling. Having already solicited
information from them at the start of play, and knowing your players
like you do, you as a GM should have a wealth of material to draw on.
It's all bait, luring players to buy into the story, made easier by the
fact that they've contributed to the foundational elements of this
story, and all you're doing now is perpetuating their involvement in it
by accepting their chips.### Roll With It

When the player contributes, go with it. Yes, they're going to likely
bring up something you didn't plan for. Yes, they're likely going to
give you something they think is great that you might think is terrible
or that it derails all your carefully laid plans. Go with it. Say "Yes"
to it and weave their idea into yours as though it has always belonged.
The bulk of creation is still yours, if you're looking for credit or
praise; they're just adding color and depth. Let them. Flexibility helps
tell the story and makes players want to play. Their enthusiasm, which
helps them want to reinforce the story, and the vibe and the shared
experience can and should totally be infectious, to you AND to the other
playersAnd you can encourage them to keep offering details, by giving details
in return. They want to tell you the details of the room they're in?
Give them details about the next room when they enter. Paint the most
evocative picture of how the badguy-of-the-week jumps, kicks, and
punches, and players will respond in kind.

In this two-stroke cycle of GM-to-player and player-to-GM, a game flows
nicely. The give and take isn't even, and isn't necessarily regular, but
there's enough movement of [[fate point]]s to tell an interesting story and
pass a few hours around the gaming table while consuming food that will
likely give you indigestion later.

But there's a third leg, making this economy a sort of isosceles
triangle, and that's when a player instigates action from another
player's aspects.

## Player to Player

This is the hardest type of economy to pull off, but it guarantees that
players won't hold onto chips: they'll be too busy using them to
strategize and further their story.

> Old Man Webster is dead; his body was stuffed in the walk-in freezer.
> Mrs. Webster, though, is alive and well and currently chasing our
> intrepid teens all through the house, with sharp knives and a
> murderous gleam in her eye.
>
> The group, newly reunited after they all took the shortcut through the
> conservatory, hides now behind a credenza. They take stock of their
> supplies.
>
> "No guns, no knives. What do we have?" asks the hunk.
>
> "I've got a shovel," says Margot.
>
> "And I've got a bag of marbles," says the stoner friend.
>
> The players all share a look, and then look at me.
>
> "John, is there a chandelier in the room?"
>
> "You tell me."
>
> Someone plunks a chip down. "Yes, there's a chandelier, of course
> there is, it's right overhead. We just need someone to climb up and
> get ready to pounce."
>
> The hunk turns to Doris, tapping her chips. "Oh look, [Being a Gymnast
> Makes Me Popular For Some Reason.]"
>
> After a bit of arguing that climbing up furniture like a cat is a lot
> harder than it looks, Doris relents, and a chip makes its way over to
> me.

It shows a certain level of involvement when one player can use the
material another player provides to help everyone get more out of the
story. In that scene with the chandelier, the players were invested in
having a certain type of situation happen, and rather than relying on GM
direction where they only had to fill in the blanks, they took the
initiative to tell me far more than I was telling them.

Yes, this means players need to know the aspects of both their character
and those of other players. Yes, that may mean they have to ask a
fiction-breaking question mid-play about who has what aspect. Let them.
Seriously, let them. Have enough confidence in yourself that you can
hook them back in, and trust them enough that they won't spend the
entire gaming session strategizing while the story sits "paused." Then
bring them back to the fiction. There's nothing wrong with a meta pit
stop, just don't let it become a protracted sidebar away from play.

---

[I often worry that a lot of traditional players come to a more "indie"
or story game with preconceived notions of competition or one-upmanship,
that they as an individual have to do better than everyone else in order
to "win." In my own experiences with my group, it did take a lot of
exposure to different games and mechanics to break the connection
between playing a game and always having a superior winning
position.]

When a player uses the mechanics to the story's advantage, rather than
their own interests, it's a signal to other players that the mechanics
are in place not to limit fun but encourage it. In the previous example,
the hunk got Doris to shimmy up the furniture and onto the chandelier,
taking Margot's shovel with her, so that when Mrs. Webster ran into the
room, she'd get a faceful of shovel. That's not a GM plan. I figured
they'd use the marbles on the ground to make her trip, or that they'd
find the rope in the shed and tie her up. Instead, we all got pleasantly
surprised when a few good rolls led to my villain eating shovel before
the police arrived.

Do I think understanding these three ideas of point exchange are going
to forever stop players from hoarding chips? No. It's going to take a
combination of investment and incentive and flexible GMing on a
situation-by-situation basis to keep the chips flowing in and out of
play as story development tools.

Because that's what gaming with your friends is: the story of you and
your friends telling shared stories that everyone has a part in, and
that everyone enjoys.
