# Musical Conflicts

by Steve Radabaugh

The musical has been a staple in Western theater for over a hundred
years; iconic musicals like _Oklahoma!_ and _West Side Story_ have even
become integral parts of Western culture. Music enhances the emotion,
action, atmosphere, and mood of a stage performance in a way that words
can't match, especially when musical numbers are strategically
placed---at emotional highpoints and key moments when dialog alone is no
longer enough.

You might want to simulate a musical number at your table because you
are doing an entire campaign that is based on a Broadway musical, or you
simply want to do something a bit different for a session---like the
musical episode in _Buffy_ in which a demon forced everyone to sing all
the time. Perhaps the player characters are actually on stage performing
for an audience!

In this article, I'll show you how to add musical conflicts to your
game, mimicking the structure of songs found in Broadway shows and rock
operas alike to model new and interesting conflicts for your gaming
group. If you've always wanted to run a gang fight as a musical show
tune, you've come to the right place.### Strict Structure

Make sure that you explain to your characters that they are doing a
conflict as a musical number before the conflict starts. The structure
of the song gives the conflict a stricter pacing than other Fate
conflicts. Players need to be aware that a song is happening---and why
it's happening---before they start.## Conflict as a Song

Songs are a performance; the player characters may or may not perform
for an actual audience, but an audience is assumed. Thus, conflicts that
happen in the form of a song need to both be resolved and stand up as a
performance for an audience. Additionally, both the song and the
conflict itself need to come to a conclusion simultaneously.

Show tunes are typically divided into four sections. Sections one, two,
and four are each a verse and a chorus. Section three is a bridge. There
are, of course, variations on this structure, but for the sake of
simplicity this article is going to stick to this format. Once you get
the hang of this type of song, you can try alternative structures with
more complicated patterns.

While the song is a group activity, each of the verses is performed by a
single character. The chorus, on the other hand, is a chance for many
characters to get involved at once.

### The First Verse

To start the conflict, one character sings a verse describing the
situation and setting up the conflict. This verse describes how things
are, identifies what's at stake in the conflict, and creates a verse
aspect that describes the situation. This serves as the introduction to
the conflict for the audience.As an option to give the players more buy-in, the GM can bring in a
template to build the lyrics to a song. Take a sheet of paper and mark
out space to do four lines for each verse and chorus. The choruses will
all be the same. To make it simple, just have the second and fourth
lines of each verse and chorus rhyme. When each player does a
verse---and the first time through the chorus---have them write the
lyrics that they are singing. Let the players collaborate as much as
needed on this.To sing the first verse, one of the players creates an advantage to
describe the situation that the song will address. The GM sets the
passive difficulty for the roll, and the player generates invokes for
success or success with style as normal.

> Jefferson and the prince are in love, but the king, who wishes a more
> traditional marriage for his son, has decreed that the prince instead
> should marry Princess Snydar. Lunser, one of Jefferson's
> friends---another player character---starts out by singing a verse
> describing the forbidden love that Jefferson and the prince share,
> creating the aspect [Forbidden Love, Traditional Marriage].

### The Chorus

Once the first verse concludes the other characters attempt to add more
free invokes to the verse aspect by singing the chorus. The chorus picks
up the theme of the song that was started in the first verse and
reinforces it.

Since everyone in the chorus is singing the same thing, they need to be
working on the same aspect, and rolling the same skill/approach against
a passive difficulty set by the GM. A success adds one free invoke to
the verse aspect; a success with style adds two free invokes.

> Jefferson and two of his other friends, Alan and Trinity, lead the
> nobles of the court in the chorus as they sing about Jefferson's love.
> The two friends sing in harmony, each lending their unique voice to
> make the song more vibrant and interesting; Alan adds one free invoke,
> and Trinity adds two free invokes.

### The Second Verse and Chorus

The character who is the main soloist for the song sings the second
verse. This character is empowered to do something about the
conflict---as opposed to the first singer who just set things up. If the
story doesn't have a single character that should be the one to act,
then the players should choose someone.

That character creates a second verse aspect that explains how they will
resolve the conflict. Then the rest of the characters attempt to add
free invokes to the new aspect during a second chorus.

> Jefferson steps forward and sings---to the king and the audience---
> about his love for the Prince. He calls out Princess Snydar as being
> unworthy of the Prince's beauty. The chorus again features Alan, Tri
> and the nobles singing about Jefferson's love and the scandal
> involved.

### The Bridge

The bridge is where the actual conflict is resolved. The two main
characters involved in the conflict roll opposed overcome rolls using
the aspects created in the previous two verses. The character who gets
the highest overall roll is the winner of the conflict.

> Princess Snydar and Jefferson duel with rapiers while singing a duet.
> They each make their opposed roll to see who the winner is.

### The Third Verse and Final Chorus

In the third verse, the conflict has been resolved. Where do the players
go from there?

The character who won the conflict in the bridge sings this verse,
describing how things are going to be different and creating an aspect
describing the new normal. The player does not need to roll: this right
is granted to the player by the victory in the bridge.

In the final chorus, the other characters again get a chance to add free
invokes to that aspect. Since this is likely the end of a scene, that
aspect and those free invokes persist on into the next scene.

### Failure in Musical Conflicts

Sometimes the character creating the aspect in the verse will fail their
roll. To keep the song entertaining for the audience, the GM gets to
create an aspect that can be compelled against the players. The
characters in the chorus can then try to make up for it by adding free
invokes to some other aspect.

During the bridge, if the soloist isn't able to overcome the obstacle,
it isn't a simple failure as normal. The song is still going to end, but
the GM determines the final aspect. If it's a song about a hero taking
out a villain and they fail, that means that the villain wins and
perhaps pushes the hero into a worse situation than they were in before.### Altering the Structure

There can be a few reasons to change the structure of the song. Three
choruses may be too many if you don't have very many characters
involved. You can reduce the number of choruses, or cut them out
completely, if it makes more sense for your game. This is especially
true if there is only one character. "Let it Go" from Frozen is a great
example of a character overcoming internal conflict in a song without
any side characters adding their voices.## Conflict Between Two PCs

Depending on your game, the song may detail a conflict between two
different players. In this case the first verse goes to the player(s) on
one side of the conflict, and the second verse goes to the player(s) on
the other side. The two players still do an opposed roll using the
aspects available to complete the bridge; the winner of this opposed
roll gets to define the aspect created in the third verse.

During the choruses of these songs, if the rest of the players are
neutral, they can either work to put free invokes on an existing aspect
or create a new aspect that reflects the nature of the conflict without
choosing a side. Any players who have a stake in the conflict can choose
to work with the chorus, or sit it out.

## What Do I Roll for a Song Conflict?

If you're using this with Fate Accelerated, you use the approach that
reflects the aspect that you are working to establish, your singing
style, and the overall mood of the song.

For [[Fate Core]], there are two options depending on the campaign: [[Rapport]]
or varying skills. If the musical is just something that the characters
are doing as part of a larger campaign---and it's not a regular
occurrence---use the [[Rapport]] skill to represent their singing and
performance ability. If the entire campaign is based around a musical,
then the [[Rapport]] skill would get overused. Instead, have the players use
the skill that reflects what that verse of the song is about, e.g. roll
[[Fight]] to sing a verse in which one character scraps with another.

## Example Song Conflict: Diesel and Moose

Tiger, Ice, Diesel, and Mouthpiece are members of a teenage gang in New
York in the 1950s. Over the last few scenes, Diesel has been building up
tension with Moose, a member of a rival gang. When the group runs into
Moose with three of his buddies, a fight between the groups breaks out.
The players and the GM agree that since the game they've been playing is
a musical, this fight needs to be a musical number rather than a
traditional Fate conflict.

Mouthpiece volunteers to take the first verse: he's not the one directly
in the conflict. The rest of the group agrees. He sings about all the
ways that Moose has wronged Diesel over their last few interactions and
about how Diesel is not someone to mess with.

The GM decides that this is a Flashy approach against a Fair (+2)
difficulty. Mouthpiece rolls his Flashy (+2) and gets ++00 for a total
of (+4) Great for a success. He creates the verse aspect [Moose Has It
Coming] with one free invoke. During the first chorus, Tiger,
Ice, and Diesel each roll their Flashy approach to try to add invokes to
that aspect. One of them succeeds so it gets one more free invoke.

Since Mouthpiece had the first verse, Diesel takes over for the second
verse to respond. He sings about the time that Moose stole his
girlfriend...and that he is going to bash Moose's face in. Everyone
agrees that this is a Forceful verse. The GM sets the difficulty to (+3)
Good. Diesel rolls his Forceful (+3) and gets 0--- for a total of (+0)
Mediocre. The GM creates the aspect [All Bark and No Bite] to
show that Moose is unimpressed.

During the chorus, the rest of the players add two free invokes to one
of Diesel's other aspects, [My Gang Has My Back], as they try
to recover from Moose's dismissal of Diesel's threats.

Since the conflict is between a PC and a specific named NPC, they do an
opposed overcome roll during the bridge. Diesel rolls his Forceful (+3)
and gets ++00 for (+5) Superb. Moose is good at fighting (+2 to any roll
involving fighting) and rolls +++0 for (+5) Superb. Both the player and
the GM spend some [[fate point]]s and their free invokes---invoking "My Gang
Has My Back" and "Moose Has It Coming"---and the roll ends up at (+9)
Legendary for Diesel and (+7) Epic for Moose.

With Diesel being the victor, he creates an aspect [Don't Mess with
Us] that gets carried forward in the story. The rest of the
players roll Flashy for the Chorus, and get to add two more free invokes
to that aspect. The gang gets to carry this new aspect into future
scenes, and everyone knows that Diesel won his conflict with Moose.
