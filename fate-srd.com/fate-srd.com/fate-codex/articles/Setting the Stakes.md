Have you ever played through a conflict that felt like a slog? Where you
weren't sure what the actual circumstances were? Where the whole thing
felt jarring and disconnected? You probably know the feeling in movies,
too. The obligatory scene of violence that happens when a producer
thinks that the audience is getting bored---the equivalent of the
obligatory conflict in a [[Fate Core]] session that nobody seems to know
what to do with. Both these things suck, and they come from the same
sort of place. The game's GM, like the movie's producer, wants the game
to be exciting so they put things in danger. However, what often happens
is that the group becomes confused and goes through the motions, without
quite knowing why they're fighting in the first place.

This isn't a unique problem to [[Fate Core]], but Fate has special tools
that can help the issue.
[Conditions](https://fate-system-toolkit/conditions/index.html) (page 18
in the Fate System Toolkit) can be used to keep play focused on
conflicts, contests, and challenges that matter. By defining conditions
in play---during scenes of exposition and other times where things
aren't blowing up---you can lend conflicts, contests, and challenges the
weight and clarity that they deserve.

## Initial Preparation

To use conditions to keep play focused on meaningful conflicts, start
off by using the guidelines from the Fate System Toolkit to create a set
of condition slots and include them on the character sheet. Don't label
them with an aspect, though. Leave them blank for now.

During play, blank conditions cannot be checked off to absorb stress.
They're the untapped potential for the stakes of your narrative. When a
player eventually fills in the label on a condition, it acts just like
conditions normally do. When the condition is recovered---all stress
boxes emptied---the player clears the slot and makes the label blank
again. The condition label must be replaced with something new before it
can be used again. You'll find more on filling in condition labels and
erasing them through recovery below.

## Setting the Stakes in Non-Conflict Scenes

In between big scenes of getting things done and coming to emotional,
mental, and physical blows, you'll have quieter scenes where things get
set up and you learn about the characters' motivations. These scenes
don't have to be long, but they should illustrate something that the
characters have to lose. If it's part of a character or campaign aspect,
that's all the better.

Before setting scenes, you should ask directly about the things that
each PC fights for. Then, choose one PC's answers and frame a scene
around them, focusing on the elements and characters they draw attention
to. Throughout the scene, prod the players to ask themselves "What's the
worst thing that could happen?" That worst-case scenario tells the
player what happens when they lose a conflict around the object they
care about, and therefore what their condition should be.

After playing the scene to its conclusion, tell players to write in
something tangible that could be risked about the object of their care
inside one of their blank conditions. The risk shouldn't be the death or
loss of that thing---extremes like that are the result of failing
conflicts outright. Rather, the condition ought to be a description of
something in the situation around the fictional element getting worse.

> Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, Peter Parker, has the aspect
> [Caring for Aunt May]. His Aunt May can't pay the bills with
> her fixed income and she worries about where he goes at night. So,
> early in the first session his player writes in the sticky lasting
> condition [Losing Aunt May's Trust]. Later, his player
> decides that he wants to highlight Peter's misfit nature in high
> school, so he writes in a fleeting condition, [Humiliation].

## Suffering Conditions

The process of suffering conditions is more flexible than consequences.
From the Fate Systems Toolkit:

> You suffer from a condition when the GM says you suffer from a
> condition---usually as a result of your narrative situation---but you
> can also use them to soak stress... You can check off as many
> conditions as you'd like for a single hit.

As a result, players have some more freedom to go to conditions as a
cost for a success on a failed overcome an obstacle or create an
advantage roll, such as those in a contest or challenge.

Doing so gives contests and challenges more teeth and excitement because
there is a risk beyond failure going into them. The player has the
choice to have an adjacent situation get worse, or to lose ground in the
present situation.

> Spider-Man has gotten into a fight with the nefarious Enforcers. To
> escape them, he has to win a contest. However, he ends up failing a
> crucial roll and runs out of webbing to swing with. He checks off his
> [Losing Aunt May's Trust] condition and ends up embroiled in
> the fight. Because he spends so much time in this brawl, he gets home
> very late. Aunt May is left to worry.

## Recovering Conditions

Recovering conditions follows the same process as in the Fate System
Toolkit (page 18), with slight adjustments. When a player wants to
recover a condition, you should frame a scene around it. Sticky
conditions will go away after they've been resolved in the fiction. For
lasting conditions, once a player has started recovering one, then you
should work together to rewrite it and reflect the resolution that comes
out of the recovery scene.

> Peter Parker comes home late after his battle with the Enforcers and
> Aunt May is waiting for him. She explains that she worries and that
> she can't take him staying out all night. She gives him a curfew and
> the recovery process for the lasting condition [Losing Aunt May's
> Trust] begins. The aspect is renamed to [Curfew] and
> Peter's player clears the first box, while the second remains checked,
> as per the standard rules.

Sticky and lasting conditions stick around until fully recovered,
checked off and unable to absorb stress. However, compels on them can
still be used to complicate the situation. In this case, the condition
intrudes on the current situation and raises the stakes of the conflict,
contest, or challenge.

> While Spider-Man fights Electro, he's about to create an advantage.
> However, the GM decides to compel his [Curfew] condition and
> have a cross Aunt May call in the middle of the fight. Now he'll have
> to talk to Aunt May and fend off her questions while battling Electro.

When a condition is fully recovered, erase it completely. It isn't an
issue anymore and can be replaced with something new.

## Rhythm

The flexible conditions system highlights a pattern of natural act
breaks in a Fate game. Establishing conditions makes for the first two
acts, the exposition and the conceit; the twist comes at the big
conflict or challenge when conditions are marked; the spiral comes out
of the compels on leftover sticky and lasting conditions; and the
resolution comes with recovery scenes.

These pieces come together to make a certain rhythm. You transition
between quieter scenes---where you establish the character and their
stakes and deal with fallout---and more chaotic scenes---where the
situation is changed irrevocably, characters come to blows, and
conditions are checked. The pattern helps to reinforce the stakes of the
campaign and the arcs of the characters. When they recover their
conditions, especially social conditions, they find time for reflection
and changing course as they process what happened. When they establish
new conditions, they spotlight how their character and the things they
care about have changed over time.

Changing conditions, when used to their fullest, can dramatically alter
the focus of the game. Instead of the immediate concerns of broken limbs
and bruised egos---standard consequences---they instead build in
complex, lasting effects that have a real impact on how the story moves
forward. Because the players took the time to write them beforehand,
when the things that their characters care about are fresh in their
minds and they're not preoccupied with a fight scene, those conditions
can carry a lot more narrative weight. They're also more well defined,
so they can be compelled more easily.

## Options

This basic system of establishing conditions, spending them, and
recovering them can make the context of the characters shine. However,
there are plenty of dials to turn regarding the specificity of the
conditions and what systems interact with them. Here are a few ways that
you can change conditions to work differently in your game.

### Stakes Types

The kinds of conditions that you include can inform the tone of your
campaign. In a mostly bloodless soap opera, perhaps one involving
pastel-colored magical ponies, social and emotional conditions may be
the most common. However, in a darker, bloodier game, physical wounds
might be more appropriate.

To use this tweak, tell the players what kinds of conditions are
fleeting, sticky, and lasting. In a superhero game, you could tell them
that a rumor is fleeting, while in a courtly romance game it would be a
dire lasting condition.

Mark each slot with a broad category, like "physical" or "reputation."
That way, you guide the players toward the subject matter that you want
for conflicts, and the kind of violence---soft, hard, social,
etc.---that you want to feature.

### Unlocking Stunts

Sometimes you want characters to hold off on using the big guns until
some condition is met, like when the circumstances are dire and they
have little choice. Sometimes, checking the condition triggers a
dangerous power that they can't quite contain. This is a common trope in
shonen martial arts manga and can be tricky to pull off in a game.

To emulate this, attach stunts to certain conditions. Only once a player
has marked off the condition, or compelled it if it's already marked,
does the player have access to the stunt. The stunt is then available
for the rest of the scene afterward. This requirement creates a
bottleneck that keeps a powerful character from steamrolling the
opposition by attaching a cost to their power.

### Minor Milestones Through Recovery

Minor milestones are often overlooked. One way to highlight each PC's
changing nature, and to highlight minor milestones as a valid option, is
to tie them into recovery instead of the break between sessions.
Whenever a PC recovers a condition they get a minor milestone and all
the perks that come from that. By presenting this as a more interactive
part of the game, you make minor milestones more attractive.

## Wrapping Up

The context of a conflict is important. Without that context of the
character's status quo and the things they care about, the conflict will
flail like a wet noodle. Using flexible conditions will help to make
conflicts, contests, and challenges relevant and tense by default. The
changing conditions highlight the context of the character's decisions,
bringing the stakes---whether they be social, emotional, physical, or
mental---to the fore. It also makes conflicts work faster and hit
harder, because you don't have to think about wording or an appropriate
cost in the middle of a scene. It's all there before the dice hit the
table, freeing you up to do more awesome stuff and think about all the
ways the situation could get worse. And the worse the odds, the better a
PC looks when they triumph.
