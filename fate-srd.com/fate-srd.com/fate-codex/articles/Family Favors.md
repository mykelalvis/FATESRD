# Family Favors

By John Large

## INTRODUCTION

One of the great things about Fate is the **bronze rule** (sometimes
called the **Fate fractal**) almost anything within Fate  can be
represented as a character with aspects, skills, and stunts, etc. Using
the bronze rule, you can represent a diverse array of different NPCs and
objects, ranging from space-craft to gigantic monster, without having to
master additional complex rules systems; once you understand the core
rules of Fate you're good to go, saving time streamlining the process of
planning your game. In many television shows, movies, and RPGs, the
central characters have the support of a large family or other
organization that provides them with back-up and occasional favors with
the understanding that something may be required in return in the
future. Organizations, whether they be families or mega-corps, can be a
great source of plot and intrigue in an RPG, as well as provide support
and aid to their members in good standing. Obviously, the bronze rule
can be used to represent these organizations, but the bronze rule alone
doesn't tie these larger groups directly into the characters themselves.

This article shows how to create organizations using the familiar Fate
rule structure, and how to make them have a more direct impact on your
game and player characters. This will not only flesh out a group that
exists in your campaign world, but will also give your heroes some extra
options when it comes to tackling stubborn problems during an adventure.

## How Central Should Organizations Be?

If you just want organizations and families as background flavor, simply
having players mention them in one of their aspects works fine; these
rules assume that you want organizations to take more of the spotlight
in your game. Here are a few ways to feature organizations using this
method:

**Have all of the PCs be members of the same organization from the
start.** This ensures the importance of a single organization it can
also tie together a group of disparate PCs, giving them a group goal and
motivation to work together, along with a valuable support structure and
hierarchy. Organizations can deliver orders, objectives, and goals to
the PCs, keeping the plot moving without introducing an artificial
framework every session.

**Feature a number of conflicting and cooperating organizations.** This
approach involves slightly more work since you may have PCs belonging to
different organizations, in addition to any NPC organizations that you
create using these rules. However, the creation process is fairly quick
and creates a ready-made source of plot for the GM. If you know that
one  of the PCs is a member of the monster-hunting Colt Family and that 
the Shandu Crime Syndicate is attempting to move in on their
neighborhood, then you have a source of conflict and plot ready to go.

### CREATING AN ORGANIZATION

First, decide what benefits membership offers and sketch out some of the
important NPCs that are involved with your organization. As with all
things in Fate, work together with your players to collaboratively build
these elements, but don't be afraid to push your players to be specific
about the organization goals, strengths, and weaknesses.

As an example of how this process works, we're going to take inspiration
from a famous TV family of smart-talking, Impala-driving monster
hunters. We're creating a group for our game called the Colt Family.
Each step of creating and organization is accompanied by a short example
of a group fleshing out the Colt Family.

## Create Organization Aspects

An organization starts with fewer aspects than a player-character or a
named NPC; these are the short sentences that help define your
organization in plain English terms that are easy to read and
understand. These aspects are:

### ORGANIZATION CONCEPT

It helps to have a clear idea of what the organization is like and how
it appears in your game. The organization concept is a short sentence
that sums up the overall theme of the group and the place that they
occupy in your campaign.

Examples:

- `Monster-Hunting Family]
- `Drug-Running Crime Syndicate]
- `Weapon-Smuggling Mafia Family]

### DARK SECRET

Every business, family, or organization has some secret or flaw that it
tries to hide, a vulnerability that can complicate life for its members.
The secret is effectively the Trouble aspect of the organization; rogue
members of the organization, a rival group, or perhaps an enemy that
they have made.

Examples:

- `We're Being Hunted by a Demon]
- `The Police Are Getting Too Close]
- `The New Mayor's Crackdown on Smuggling]

### ORGANIZATION GOAL

Most organizations are either founded with a goal in mind, such as
making money or selling a product), or develop a goal as time goes on,
as in the case of our monster-hunting family. The organization goal
summarizes the main aims of the group in your game; not all members will
slavishly follow this goal to the same degree, but having this written
down from the start can help guide decisions on what sort of resources
the organization has access to and how willing they are to help the PCs
in various endeavors.

Examples:

- `Track Down the Creature]
- `Over the Drug Trade in the City]
- `We Need to Show the Mayor Who's Boss]

## Creating Organization Faces

Create an NPC to represent each of the aspects you choose for your
family or organization; for the _**Organization Concept**_, this will
normally be the head of the family, whereas the _**Dark Secret**_ might
be a troublesome police office or customs official, someone who causes
issues and complications for the organization. The NPC for the
_**Organization Goal**_ can be viewed as a standard member of the
organization whether that be a mobster or a monster hunter.

These NPCs do not have to be generated entirely, as with PCs but they
should at least be given a name and a _**High**_ _**Concept**_ to
describe them; if they prove to be more major figures in your campaign,
then you can easily add stats to them later. More general members of the
family can be created using the rules for _**Nameless NPCs**_ or even
the _**Mook**_ rules from Fate Accelerated. The aspects chosen for the
organization should give you a pretty good idea of the things your NPC
will be skilled and unskilled at.

> secure supplies while engaging in their main activity of hunting down
> monsters.
>
> For our Organization Concept we go for `Driven Monster Hunting

> of its activities, mostly the creatures that they hunt and their
> servants, so we pick `Hunted by Demons] for the Dark Secret.
> We decide that the family patriarch will be the NPC that we define for

> Concept `That Monster Took My Wife...]
>

> is more to the demon than simply random murders.

> the crusade to prevent the same terrible ordeal happening to other
> families. We choose `Protect our Home and the People from
> Demons] as an aspect.
>
> For this aspect, we create a member of the family, naming him Terrence

> digging up lore, and a -2  at anything involving background checks or
> the legal system. Knowing what a baseline member of an organization
> looks like will help you to define areas where the player characters
> differ from this or are exceptional; it also means that if your
> players call in a favor to get some back-up, then you have stats for
> them ready made.

## Choose Organization Skills

Each organization has a pool of skills related to its main business
interests. For example, our monster-hunting family might have caches of
equipment buried across the country, accessible to any member who needs
gear. Taking some levels of [[Resources]] to represent this would be
appropriate, as would a few levels of [[Contacts]] to represent folks in the
community who support their work.

Choose three skills from the standard list to represent the skill pool
possessed by the family; one of the skills should be rated at +2 and the
others at +1 each. When a PC successfully calls on skilled aid from a
member of the organization, they can add this bonus to their own skill
check to represent the assistance that they are receiving.

> The members of the family use various confidence schemes and scams to
> make ends meet, allowing them to follow their true calling. They've
> learned a lot about monsters, though so we set [[Lore]] at +2, [[Investigate]]
> at +1, and [[Burglary]] at +1, giving members of the family a chance to
> call on their fellows for assistance with investigating monsters and
> their weaknesses or engaging in more larcenous pursuits.

## Create an Organization Favor Track

The favor track works like the consequences slot on the main character
sheet, save that the number of boxes is dependent on the size and reach
of the organization; a very small organization might have one box, a
medium-sized organization four, and a countrywide organization eight.
This is used to keep track of how many favors the PCs have called in
from this organization. We'll cover how to use this track a bit later in
the article.

### **JOINING AN ORGANIZATION**

In order to claim the benefits of being in an organization using these
rules, PCs must make mention of their membership in one of their
aspects.

Player characters may also seek to join an organization after play has
begun, although organizations will certainly only extend a membership
invitation to those who have proven their worthiness and have passed
tests of loyalty. Assuming that a PC has been accepted into the ranks of
an organization, then they should change one of their character's
aspects to reflect their membership; this can be done normally as per
the rules for milestones.

For example:

- `Black Sheep of the Colt Family]
- `Rising Star in the Shandu Crime Syndicate]
- `Made Man of the Malvolo Family]

### USING ORGANIZATIONS IN PLAY

Now that you've got your Organization or Family fleshed out, it's time
to integrate it into your game.

#### Organization Aspects

One of the chief benefits of belonging to an organization using these
rules is that the player can call on the aspects of the organization as
though they were their own.

In fact, a player may invoke the aspects of their family without paying
a [[fate point]]. However, each time they do, they accrue a favor owed to
the family, and the character's name should be written in one of the
favor track boxes. When all of the favor track boxes are full, no
additional favors may be called upon from the family until some of the
existing ones have been paid off.

> The Colt family has `Protect our Home and the People from
> Demons] as their Organization Goal; if our PC, Simon Colt, is
> confronted by a demonic creature threatening his neighbors, then he
> could either pay a [[fate point]] to invoke the organization aspect as
> though it were one of his own or he could choose to save his fate
> points and instead accrue a favor to the family.

### Information and Clues

Alternatively, when a player needs information in a hurry, they can
choose to accrue a favor in order to be put in touch with someone who
has the appropriate information by a member of their organization. The
exact nature of the clue is up to the GM, but generally you should allow
a player to do this if the information is at all relevant to the group's
Organization Concept.

> If the PCs are members of the Colt Family and are trying to dig up
> some information on the nesting habits of a particularly vile
> supernatural creature, then one of them could accrue a favor in order
> to get some info from another family member who has faced the creature
> or something like it before.
>
> However, if the PCs were looking for information on the inner-workings
> of the police department or city hall, then being a member of the
> family would not be much use; they would have to investigate this
> matter personally, perhaps attempting to bribe a corrupt official or
> leaning on other contacts outside the organization in order to obtain
> this information.

### Skilled Aid

Occasionally, even Fate characters have to call on the assistance of
people with higher levels of ability. Being a member of an organization
grants a PC access to other NPCs with variable skill pools; this is
represented by the three skills chosen for the organization. If a PC
wishes assistance from a member of their organization, then they may
accrue a favor in order to have someone assist them, as long as it's
feasible that another member of the organization could turn up and help
them.

When gaining skilled help the PC should name the NPC helping them and
define their area of expertise; they may then add the relevant
organization skill rating to their roll in addition to their own skill.

> Our member of the Colt Family is attempting to commit a burglary,
> breaking into the house of a person he believes serves the creature
> they are hunting; unsure whether his burglary skill of +1 will be
> enough, he contacts his cousin Terrence and arranges for them to meet
> up. The Colt Family has a burglary skill of +1, meaning that when
> Terrence arrives, the player adds an additional +1 for his burglary
> attempt, but he will owe the family some assistance in return in the
> future.

### General Assistance

Players can normally spend [[fate point]]s to declare fictional details. For
example, they might spend a [[fate point]] to say there is a barrel of oil
in a warehouse or that there is a single horse in the tavern barn;
player characters who are members of a family or organization can owe a
favor in order to do similar things with their organization, either
receiving minor aid or filling in additional setting details.

Minor aid is something like crashing on a cousin's couch for the evening
or borrowing a small amount of money, basically anything that doesn't
put the family out or cause it significant expenditure.

To add additional setting details, the player accrues a favor and then
narrates how the organization has either members or resources in the
area that favor them in some way; for example, our member of the Colt
Family needs to get his car fixed and accrues a favor to say that the
mechanic knows his family and occasionally helps them out because they
once helped his daughter who was possessed by an angry spirit.

When doing this the player should at least name the NPC or the resource
and describe why being a member of the organization makes them available
to them; final refusal of these elements rests with the GM, who may
choose to either suggest alterations or disallow the adding of details
if they seem entirely inappropriate.

### Paying Off Favors

There are two ways that favors can be paid off:

- If the GM issues a compel related to the family's aspects and the
  player character has a favor box with their name on it, then the
  favor is paid off and their name removed from the track. The player
  may not pay a [[fate point]] to avoid the compel as per the normal
  rules, since they have already received the benefits when they
  accepted the favor earlier in the game.
- The PC can self-compel using one of the organization's aspect most
  likely the Dark Secret; assuming the GM approves the compel, then
  the player may choose to have one of their favors paid off instead
  of taking a [[fate point]].

### CONFLICT BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS

If you wish to represent conflict between organizations and families in
a more direct manner, then you can give your organizations stress boxes
and consequences like any other character. Attacks that would directly
harm the family can be represented by them taking consequences in the
same manner as a character would. When an organization is taken out of
action, it means that it has fractured to such an extent that it is no
longer capable of functioning in a cohesive manner.

In conclusion, using the rules in this article will help you create
organizations that can be directly involved in your game without taking
agency away from your players. These groups form a backdrop for your
game, allowing the PCs access to additional resources but at the cost of
further potential story complications down the line.
