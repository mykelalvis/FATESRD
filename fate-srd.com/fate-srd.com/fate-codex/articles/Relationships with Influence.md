# Relationships with Influence

_by Steve Radabaugh_

## Relationships with Influence

Unlike most roleplaying games, traditional fiction often has a single
central character exerting influence over multiple side characters. In
this variation of Fate, the players play all of the characters that
surround that central character. Each character relationship, expressed
as an Extra, allows influence to be exerted and received, shaping the
decision-making process. Playing stories where one player ends up
playing the main character makes it difficult to let all the players
feel like they're contributing equally. The mechanic presented here
allows you to play those stories giving all the players an equal
footing.

While it may sound like a hard sell to convince a gaming group to spend
some time playing secondary characters, it is fun to play games from a
different perspective once in a while. Think of space pirates all
influencing their captain, college students influencing the star
football player, or a game based on a reality TV show where people
compete for the heart of one bachelor or bachelorette.

### Central Character Creation

Creating this central character is a collaborative activity, and should
be done before the players create their own characters. Grab a piece of
paper and start asking the players about their main character. Start
with broad questions: who are they, where did they grow up, what makes
them special? As you get answers ask more specific questions based on
those answers. Watch for places where the players disagree on the
central character's beliefs or morals. Those disagreements might breed
aspects that some of the player characters will try to change about the
central character. The players don't all have to be a fan of the central
character, but they should all find the character compelling.

Once your group has started to develop the central character, give that
character a high concept, trouble, and three additional aspects. Don't
worry about skills, stunts, and refresh. Make sure that all of the
players are happy with the character. If you don't yet have a set world,
you should also go through that process as described in [[Fate Core]]. In
fact, world building and the central character building can happen
concurrently, each influencing the other.

After the world and central character are created, the players each
create their own character. The players need to keep in mind that their
characters are not the stars of the show, but rather they are the
secondary characters. They may not be creating Picard, but they are
creating the rest of the bridge crew. The characters should still be
compelling and interesting. However, the most important part of these
characters is their relationship with the central character; make sure
that you know the connection of each player character to the central
character as you create them. The natural thing to do in Fate is to
express the relationship as an aspect; the better solution here is to
make the relationship an extra.

### Relationship as an Extra

#### Connection Aspect

Each player character has a relationship with the central character as
an Extra taken at no additional cost. The relationship starts with a
connection aspect that states the nature of the relationship and who it
is with. Our sample character, Ricardo, has the relationship ["Nephew of
Major Marge."]

#### Point of Contention Aspect

Because happy-go-lucky relationships aren't as interesting, this
relationship needs a point of contention aspect. It is something that
the central character and the player character don't agree on. It should
be something that adds some drama to the game. Ricardo's relationship
has the aspect ["Marge Doesn't Approve of Lucy, My
Girlfriend."]

#### Bonding Moment Aspect

The relationship also starts with one bonding moment aspect that
describes a specific event between the player character and the central
character that helped forge their relationship. This bonding moment can
be invoked to influence the central character when trying to convince
them of a course of action. Over the course of a campaign a character
will add new bonding moments to this relationship. When something
happens between the player's character and the central character that
you think makes a good bonding moment, write it down and save it. When
the player reaches a milestone they get to add a bonding moment aspect
to the relationship. You will hopefully have several written down for
the player to choose from.

> Ricardo is trying to convince Major Marge that they should keep more
> guards posted around the perimeter of the camp to watch for zombies.
> He rolls his [[Rapport]] and gets (+2) Fair, but needed to get (+3) Good.
> He spends a [[fate point]] to invoke Camping Trip in the Ozarks to remind
> Marge of the dangers in the wild and raise his roll to a (+4) Great.

The relationship also has a stress track. The number of stress boxes in
it is equal to the number of bonding moments that the relationship has.
A new relationship will have one stress box, with more being earned as
bonding moments develop.

There may be other characters who see things differently than the
players do, and find that relationship a hindrance to their goals. They
can work to undermine that relationship.

> Mr. Thompson doesn't like that Major Marge keeps deferring to her
> nephew on all of her important decisions. In an attempt to disgrace
> Ricardo, he brings in some fake evidence that implicates Ricardo in
> some nefarious things to a meeting with Ricardo and Major Marge.
> Thompson rolls his [[Provoke]] (+4) Great and gets +0++ for a total of
> (+7) Epic. Ricardo tries to defend with his [[Rapport]], but only rolls a
> total of (+3) Good. With four [[shift]]s, he needs to use up two of the
> stress boxes on the relationship and take a Mild consequence of In an
> Argument. Until that consequence passes, the GM will be able to invoke
> it to give Mr. Thompson bonuses to convince Major Marge that Ricardo
> is wrong.

As the campaign progresses, relationships will evolve, just like
characters do. Each time a character reaches a significant milestone in
addition to normal advancement, they can add a bonding moment to the
relationship up to a total of three times. After the third, the player
can replace an existing bonding moment with a new one. These should be
things that have happened between the characters in the story. The
number of stress boxes in the relationship will always match the number
of bonding moments the relationship has. It will start with one, and get
up to three.

> Ricardo has reached a couple significant milestones after surviving
> several weeks in the zombie apocalypse. He and Marge saw quite a bit
> of combat together. He replaces the "Camping in the Ozarks" bonding
> moment with "We Had Each Other's Back When The Zombies Took Ft. Koni."
> Also, since it makes sense in the story, "Marge Doesn't Approve of
> Lucy, My Girlfriend" gets replaced with the new point of contention
> aspect "Marge Didn't Cry When the Zombies Ate Lucy".

Your group may use this mechanic just as presented, or it may end up
being a smaller part of your campaign. Meaty relationships can be tricky
when it comes to roleplaying, and this system will give you more options
to incorporate dynamic, evolving connections.
