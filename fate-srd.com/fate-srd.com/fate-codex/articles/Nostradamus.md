## Seattle, October 1972

The Pacific Northwest was a hotbed of cultural and social change
throughout the 1960s; the burgeoning environmental movement, a steady
influx of new residents and development, and an economic boom all
contributed to the collective consensus that the "Puget Sound
promise"---economic prosperity and inclusion for all throughout the
region---was close to being fulfilled. But as the '70s dawned,
Seattleites were reminded that nothing lasts forever. Puget Sound, like
the rest of America, soon found that the idyllic dreams of the '60s gave
way to a waking world of unemployment, high oil prices, and public
malaise. And that's when the murders started...### Who Is the Nostradamus Killer?

The setting of Nostradamus is drawn from the real history of Seattle in
1972, but the Nostradamus killer is entirely fictional. Who the killer
is, what he hopes to achieve, and what the characters learn about him is
completely up to you to discover over the course of play. Don't worry
too much about historical accuracy---pick up the elements you think are
interesting from the setting and use Fate mechanics to create the best
story you can.### The Pike's Place Murders

In November of 1971, Seattle residents were stunned by the kidnapping
and murder of two local teens, Hiro Hamasaki and Rolando Diaz. The two
boys, walking home from West Seattle High one late fall afternoon,
vanished without a trace. Two weeks later, three days before
Thanksgiving, a local homeless man found their bodies near Pike's Place
Market. The discovery made front page headlines across the country,
almost derailing attempts to preserve the market region as a historical
site.

Worse yet, the Seattle police were unable to gather any concrete leads
about the murders; a few months into the investigation, the police were
forced to admit that the trail had gone cold. Conspiracies continued to
abound about the exact nature of their deaths, but the police refused to
release autopsies, crime scene photos, or interviews with key witnesses,
claiming that the "ongoing nature of the case" prohibited them from
sharing what they knew.

### The Mabus Letters

The Pike's Place Murders were once again thrust into the spotlight six
months later in May of 1972 when the Seattle Gazette published a three
part series of letters, which included a lengthy cipher consisting of
non-alphanumeric characters, allegedly delivered to the paper over a
period of seven weeks. The letters---written by someone called Mabus or
The Mabus---contained previously unreleased information about the murder
of the two teens...and similar information about three murders of
Seattle residents since 1969, all victims who had been shot by a similar
weapon while hiking or exploring areas around Seattle. The writer of the
letters claimed to have committed all the murders described, and offered
vivid accounts of specific details of each killing.

The Mabus letters, as the Gazette called them, were an instant classic;
Seattle residents snapped up all the initial issues of the Gazette's
print run, prompting a reprint almost immediately. The Gazette claimed
to have verified the information provided through police sources, but
the Seattle police force declined to comment.

### The Fifty-Sixth Quatrain

A few days after the Mabus letters were published by the Gazette, a
cryptology professor named Dr. Erica Tyska solved the cipher,
discovering the following message:

> ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT WHICH YOU SHOULD KNOW BUT IGNORE THE MABUS
> WILL TELL YOU BECAUSE YOUR DEATHS SHOULD NOT BE IN VAIN <BREAK>
> SOONER AND LATER YOU WILL SEE GREAT CHANGES MADE <BREAK> DREADFUL
> HORRORS AND VENGEANCES <BREAK> FOR AS THE MOON IS THUS LED BY ITS
> ANGEL <BREAK> THE HEAVENS DRAW NEAR TO THE BALANCE <BREAK> WISE MEN
> HEED MABUS AND DESPAIR FOOLS SUFFER ALONE

Dr. Tyska solved the cipher by recognizing the text of the middle
stanzas as belonging to prophecies of Nostradamus (Century 1, Quatrain
56); she explained later that the killer's pseudonym, Mabus, was an
obvious tip off, a reference to Nostradamus's work that immediately gave
her a database of words from which to work. Tyska also discovered
several instances of language from other quatrains in several of the
Mabus letters, indicating to her that the relationship between the
killer and Nostradamus was more than coincidental.

The media immediately grabbed onto the Nostradamus angle, and references
to "Mabus" dried up overnight. Local tabloids harped on "the Nostradamus
killer," looking for references to the murders in other quatrains and
plastering images of a bloody Nostradamus across the front pages of
every newspaper in the city. For three months, the city was held rapt by
the tabloid coverage of the murders...but their attention gave way by
the time University of Washington students resumed their studies in the
fall. Many Seattle residents even came to believe the entire case was a
fraud perpetrated by the Gazette to sell papers as the economy slowed.

### The Marymoor Park Survivor

Whatever hopes Seattleites had for escaping further murders at the hands
of the Nostradamus killer were shattered when a young couple was
attacked while picnicking on the banks of Lake Sammamish in Marymoor
Park in late September 1972. Eric Wells and Caitlyn Ortega, students at
University of Washington, were interrupted by a man wearing a hoodie,
large antlers, and a mask, holding a revolver and demanding that they
both lie down on the ground. Once the students were prone, the man shot
Eric Wells five times in the head and neck, then turned to Ortega and
shot her once directly in the back, then reloaded and shot her six more
times. After securing several pieces of paper to their bodies, the
killer left the scene.

Wells was pronounced dead at the scene, but the tourist who found the
two victims was able to save Ortega's life. Ortega was later able to
provide details on the killer---a white male, approximately 5' 11",
200-250 lbs, dressed in a strange outfit---but did not notice any
identifying marks. No one reported seeing the man with antlers, nor were
police able to recover any meaningful physical evidence from the scene
of the crime.

The Gazette reported a few weeks later---despite protestations from the
police---that the paper the Nostradamus killer attached to the victims'
bodies contained stanzas of Century VIII, Quatrain 41, scrawled in
charcoal on small slips of newspaper:

> a fox will be elected without speaking one word,
>
> appearing saintly in public living on barley bread,
>
> afterwards he will suddenly become a tyrant
>
> putting his foot on the throats of the greatest men.

### Terror in Jet City

By the time October of 1972 hits Seattle, full on terror grips the city;
many people talk about the next Nostradamus kills as a certainty, as if
there's no question that he will kill again before he's caught. The
police claim that they're making headway into the case, but no arrests
have been made; the Gazette claims they have more letters, but the
Marymoor killings have convinced them that publishing more ciphers does
nothing to keep people safe.

Rumors have also started to swirl that the Nostradamus killer is fond of
The Zombie's 1969 hit "Time of the Season," and young people out late at
night play the song regularly as a sort of protection charm, turning the
pop hit into the unintentional theme song of the Nostradamus killer.
Anyone walking out after dark, in the gloomy rain and cold of Seattle in
October, is sure to hear the song echoing out of an open car window or
cracked door, a haunting reminder that until he is caught, the city
still belongs to the Nostradamus killer.

## Setting Creation

As a Quick Start Adventure, Nostradamus has everything you need to jump
right into your first session. Before you start, discuss the broader
setting with your group, perhaps even reading aloud the descriptions of
the Pike's Place Murders, the Mabus Letters, the Fifty-Sixth Quatrain,
The Marymoor Park Survivor, and Terror in Jet City so everyone is on the
same page. Given the graphic nature of this Quick Start's mystery, it's
also worth having a brief discussion about safety mechanisms (see [Sarah
Richardson's Feminine Horror piece for safety
resources](../feminine-horror/index.html)).

At the start of play, explain the **current issue** to your players and
ask them to fill in one or two additional faces associated with **The
Nostradamus Killings**. These additional characters will provide plot
hooks and twists that deepen the mystery of the Nostradamus killer and
develop conflicts in the backdrop of the terror that grips Seattle.
Character write-ups for the existing faces attached to the current issue
are provided, as those characters are likely to be central to the story.

After explaining the current issue, ask your players to choose from one
of the two available **impending issues**: [The Boeing Bust] or
[Pike Place Preservation]. This impending issue will act as a
central point of contact for the characters, a location or problem
around which the characters' relationships will circle before they get
involved with the killer. Have the players fill in one or two additional
faces for their chosen impending issue as well, rounding out the larger
cast of characters with their suggestions.

### Current Issue: The Nostradamus Killings

The murders claimed by the man calling himself Mabus have chilled
Seattle to the core; no one is sure when he will strike again or who
will be his next victim, given that none of the existing victims appear
to have anything in common. Since efforts by local law enforcement have
been utterly ineffective at discovering his identity (or stopping the
murders), the very foundation of civic order in the city is starting to
unravel. Many residents are convinced that the killer is a harbinger of
the future of the city, an early omen of the urban decay that threatens
to undermine the Puget Sound promise, and the populace is a powder keg
of fear and unease ready for a match.

Faces:

- Detective Mark Montgomery, the lead homicide detective assigned to
  the murder of Eric Wells
- Caitlin Ortega, the sole survivor of the Nostradamus attack that
  killed Eric Wells

### Impending Issues

In addition to The Nostradamus Killings that have gripped the city,
there are a number of other impending issues that residents of Seattle
are grappling with in the early 1970s:

### The Boeing Bust

After World War II, Seattle underwent an economic transformation fueled
by investments in education and infrastructure, a growing population,
and the success of the largest local employer, Boeing. Yet as the space
program ground to a halt in the late '60s and fuel prices spiked,
Boeing's fortunes took a turn for the worse: the airline giant laid off
70% of their Seattle workforce, an economic catastrophe that echoed
throughout the city. In 1972, unemployment in Seattle has reached double
digits (12%) and local political leaders see few options for turning
things around quickly. Many young people in Seattle are contemplating
leaving for greener pastures, and a new billboard has gone up near the
airport:

![](https://sites/default/files/images/codex/v2issue6/lights.jpg)

Faces:

- Carla Powdrell, an established African-American community organizer
  in Seattle
- Wesley C. Ulhman, the young mayor of Seattle, elected in 1969 by an
  optimiztic youth movement

### Pike's Place Preservation

The local recession may have crippled local businesses, but local
community groups secured a major victory in preserving the historic
Pike's Place Market for public development in late 1971. Pike's Place
Market---a multi-block open air market and famous Seattle landmark---was
scheduled to be torn down in the early 1970s by private developers, but
community efforts to protect the location caused the city council to
pass an initiative that established the market as a historic landmark
and returned the market to public ownership. As construction begins to
restore the original space into a modern market, the renovations offer
unique opportunities for developers, organizers, and merchants, all of
whom want to secure their own vision for the Pike's Place Market
project.

Faces:

- Betty Bowen, journalist and philanthropist instrumental in saving
  Pike's Place Market from redevelopment
- Michael Matsumodo, a local developer and consultant to the Pike's
  Place Market Preservation and Development Authority

## Character Creation

In Nostradamus, players take on the role of ordinary people caught up in
the dangerous mystery of the Nostradamus killer, drawn deeper into a
case that threatens to destroy their families and identities even if
they emerge with their lives.

Unlike the detectives of a more traditional police procedural, the
characters in Nostradamus are not police officers assigned to a
particular case (see Impending Issues later in this section for more on
Mark Montgomery, the homicide detective assigned to the Nostradamus
case). Instead they are curious onlookers who become embroiled in the
case even as people tell them to mind their own business and let the
police do their job.

In order to give their relationships some structure, each character
should tie into the impending issue selected at the start of the session
(either [The Boeing Bust] or [Pike's Place
Preservation]) in addition to their other relationship aspects.
These characters don't have to be good friends---a labor organizer
working at Boeing, a mechanic who is out of work because of layoffs, and
a Boeing executive all tie into [The Boeing Bust] without
necessarily being close companions before the start of the story.

In general, Nostradamus works best with [[Fate Core]] characters, since the
different investigators can bring different skills to bear on the
mystery. Fate Accelerated approaches don't permit players to make
characters that are substantially different from each other in capacity
and talents. Characters only receive one stunt and two refresh in this
Quick Start.

### Aspects

Characters in Nostradamus start by selecting a **high concept** and
**trouble**. Since the characters are ordinary people, players should
select high concepts that put them in contact with the killer's messages
and victims---[Prize Journalist for the Gazette], [Underpaid
Public Servant], [Dedicated Labor Organizer],
etc.---and focus on trouble aspects that might push them toward the
mystery---[Failing Marriage], [Nosy and Nervous],
[Drawn to Death].### Avoiding Intrinsic Aspects

Instead of traditional stress, Nostradamus uses [damaged aspects from
Brendan Conway's Damaged Aspects](../damaged-aspects/index.html). Make
sure to create aspects that are states instead of intrinsic facts so
that the aspects can degrade over time.In addition to their high concept and trouble, players should also
select a **connection aspect** to explain how they are connected to the
Nostradamus killer and two **investigator aspects** to create
relationships among the PCs. These aspects are essentially a modified
phase trio, but tell the PCs to focus on regular connections and
involved relationships that require consistent contact; the mystery will
require their characters to push on through danger and disappointment,
and they will want to earn compels from their aspects to do so. See the
Sample Characters for examples of strong connection and relationship
aspects.

### Skill List

Nostradamus uses a modified [[Fate Core]] skill list that has been
recontextualized to better fit a 1970s murder mystery. Most skills
remain unchanged ([[Contacts]], [[Empathy]], [[Investigate]], [[Provoke]], [[Rapport]],
[[Resources]], [[Will]]), but others have been removed completely ([[Athletics]],
[[Burglary]], [[Crafts]], [[Deceive]], [[Drive]], [[Fight]], [[Notice]], [[Shoot]], and [[Stealth]]) and
many that stayed have undergone some substantial revisions. In addition,
Nostradamus features a new skill that can be added to any campaign:
**Command**.

#### Evasion

Nostradamus combines elements of [[Deceive]] and [[Stealth]] into Evasion, the
art of avoiding conflicts and problems physically and socially. Whenever
a character tries to weasel out of a situation, they roll Evasion to
determine if they can avoid or undermine a conflict instead of facing it
head on. Characters with low Evasion tend to stumble into conflicts,
requiring them to engage instead of avoid problems.### Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics

Nostradamus allows a character to deceive other characters using any
social skill---Command, [[Provoke]], or [[Rapport]]---as well as Evasion, but
places the focus on how the character is attempting to deceive the
target. Con artists are prone to creating advantages with [[Rapport]] to
establish false trust, while a guilty wife avoiding questions about an
affair would try to overcome the questions with Evasion to cover her
tracks.

## Command

While [[Rapport]] builds trust and [[Provoke]] inspires emotion, Command works
to push people to comply with orders, instructions, and demands based on
the authority of the speaker. Characters who have extensive management
experience (or law enforcement training) usually have high ratings in
Command.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: You can use Command to give orders to susceptible targets,
especially people who are panicking or lost or explicitly under your
authority. You might also use Command to project an air of authority
when someone questions your qualifications or doubts your sincerity.

**Discover:** Command allows you to observe and interpret authority
structures broadly--- understanding who is in charge and how the system
works---without needing to be told directly by people "in the know."
Questions revolving around Command typically involve asking about the
power dynamics of a situation, especially in regards to formal
authority.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Command allows you to create aspects to
represent orders or instructions given to a group by a capable
commander, such as ["Take That Hill!"] or ["We're All in This
Together"]. Other uses include distracting your
opposition---["Freeze!"]---or cutting off options to other
characters through the force of your presence---["I'm the Boss
Here"].

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Command is typically not used to attack. If you wish to
inflict emotional stress, you'll have to use [[Provoke]].

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Command defends against any skill used to compel other
people to follow the orders or interests of your opposition instead of
your orders or interests. It does not defend, however, against people
giving you orders. You need [[Will]] for that.

### Necromancy Stunts

**Control, Don't Feel.** Once per session, you can gird yourself against
what's to come by giving yourself orders and instructions. Roll Command
against a Fair (+2) difficulty to [[create advantage]] on yourself with
two free invokes on a success and three free invokes on a success with
style.

**No Questions.** You can use Command to avoid answering questions
instead of Evasion, provided you have enough authority in the situation
to cut off or interrupt the questioner.#### Cryptography ([[Lore]])

Rather than offer [[Lore]] for information about serial killers---an
incredibly specific field of knowledge---or the city of Seattle---a
broad set of information that may or may not be useful, Nostradamus
features Cryptography, the study of the codes and ciphers that happen to
play a central role in the killings. Characters can use Cryptography to
learn more about the ciphers, evaluate what the killer must know to
construct the ciphers, or crack the ciphers directly (with enough time).

#### [[Physique]]

Nostradamus combines all the physical skills---[[Athletics]], [[Fight]], [[Shoot]],
and [[Physique]]---into a single skill. Characters with a high [[Physique]]
might be ex-cops or soldiers returning from Vietnam, people who have
some broad physical training in a setting where most people probably
don't know how to handle themselves in a fight or shoot a gun
effectively.

#### Survival

Nostradamus uses the Survival skill developed by Ryan Macklin in The
Fate Codex, Volume 1, Issue 2. Investigators use Survival to navigate
the wilderness surrounding the city, to discover crucial resources and
escape routes in tense situations, and for determining who acts first in
a physical conflict.

#### Limited Skill Pyramid

In addition to the modified skill list, characters begin with a reduced
skill pyramid that tops out at Good (+3) instead of Great (+4). Note
that this has two important effects: fate dice and [[fate point]]s now
matter more relative to the character's skills, and traditional
difficulties---Fair (+2)---are slightly harder than normal. Both of
these changes are subtle ways of upping the horror quotient in Fate;
look to Richard Bellingham's article Sustaining Dread on page 4 for more
ideas to make Nostradamus truly terrifying.

#### Damaged Aspects

As stated above, Nostradamus uses damaged aspects from [Brendan Conway's
Damaged Aspects piece](../damaged-aspects/index.html) instead of
traditional stress tracks. There's no way to earn additional stress
boxes through [[Physique]] or [[Will]], and you may want to reduce the number of
stress boxes per aspect from five to three if you want to play a short
game.

## New Extra: Suspects

Rather than force the GM to create a fixed mystery that the characters
must explore, Nostradamus leaves the question of the killer's identity
open. Over the course of several scenes, the players provide input
through the use of **suspects**---NPCs flagged as potential murderers by
the players before the story begins.

### Creating Suspects

After creating their characters, each player creates a suspect for the
player to their right, an NPC that the target player's character
believes might be the Nostradamus killer. The suspect creator details
three things: the character's name, their relationship to the target PC,
and an **evidence aspect** that captures why the target PC has grown
suspicious. By default, these characters must all be white men,
approximately twenty to forty years of age, and familiar with firearms
and codes. Anyone else is not a believable suspect, and the characters
must believe deeply that the suspect they are connected to might really
be the killer.

> Sean is sitting to the left of Kendyl, so he starts to create a
> suspect for her when he's done with his own character. Since Kendyl's
> character, Aisho, is the [Owner of a Pike's Place Stall], he
> decides to create a regular customer, Isaac, who buys fish from her
> once a week, after he gets off his [[shift]] as a longshoreman. He tells
> her that Isaac fits the profile, and that she knows that he served in
> Vietnam in the late 1960s, returning to Seattle after his tour as a
> communications officer. He finishes off the suspect with the evidence
> aspect [Missing Weeks] and tells Kendyl that Isaac only
> missed picking up his fish two weeks out of the last two years---the
> same two weeks that Aisho's son and Rolando Diaz were missing before
> they were found dead.

Once all of the suspects have been created, the GM secretly adds a
suspect stress track to each one. The length of the suspect track should
correspond with the length of the game; a multi-session game might have
five to six boxes, while a short game may just have two to three.

### Using Suspects for Scenes

Each scene of Nostradamus revolves around one of the suspects created by
the players, either as direct investigations of the mystery surrounding
the men that might be responsible or scenes that play out the
consequences of the PCs' investigations in their personal lives. It's
crucial that these scenes be tightly constructed in order to maximize
the tension; it's hard to stay in a horror mindset if every other scene
is about something completely unrelated to the Nostradamus killer.

At the start of each scene, the GM helps to facilitate scene setting by
asking the group which suspect seems most interesting at that point in
the story. Once the group decides on a suspect, the GM frames the scene
with multiple characters, entangling several different threads to keep
any one character from getting too focused on one and only one suspect.

> For the first scene, the group agreed that it would be interesting to
> focus on Aisho's suspect, Isaac. Since Brendan is GMing, he says,
> "Great. Let's have a few of you trailing him home to get a look at his
> place. Aisho, how did you get Oscar to help you out here? Why did he
> agree to come with you to trail Isaac? Was it because he's a reporter
> who [Needs to Get the Story]?"
>
> After that scene is resolved, the group agrees that the next scene
> should focus around Emily's boss, Alexander. Brendan frames that scene
> as well: "Okay, I think we'll have a scene between Emily, Oscar, and
> Alexander's wife, June. You're all at a party for the firm and she
> starts asking questions about her husband. Emily, what do you think
> she knows about the book?"

### Resolving Suspects

For each scene that concerns a suspect, the GM marks one of the stress
boxes associated with that character, even if the suspect is only
discussed and not directly engaged in the scene. Once all the stress
boxes have been filled, the GM has to make a decision about the
character: what is this person hiding? Is this the killer? The GM
doesn't share this decision, but from that point forward, everything the
character does is in line with that new reality. It's possible that none
of the suspects is the killer or that there are multiple killers, but
nothing is decided until the stress tracks have been filled.

> After a few scenes, Brendan marks all the stress boxes on Isaac's
> suspect track. He decides, based on what they've found already, that
> Isaac is not the killer. In fact, Brendan decides that Isaac actually
> spent those missing two weeks looking for the boys, deeply concerned
> about Aisho and her family. All further evidence that the PCs discover
> will confirm this fact, and Brendan now only has two suspects left who
> could possibly be the Nostradamus killer.

## Plot Hooks and Further Mysteries

The players may have solved the mystery of the Nostradamus killer---or
wisely decided to let the case go and go back to their lives...but
that's not the end of the mysteries that abound in Jet City. Here are a
few plot hooks and further mysteries to keep the investigators looking
for bodies:

### Once More, With Feeling

Weeks after the capture (or death) of the Nostradamus killer, another
body is discovered, murdered in a similar style: same kind of gun, same
attached note, etc. Another letter arrives at the Seattle Gazette
demanding that a cipher be published so that "the great game can
continue." But the correspondence and many details at the scene don't
match the original letters, and the police suspect that a copycat killer
is on the loose. Who is copying the Nostradamus killer? Are they
committed to his mad plan or simply using the original murders to throw
the police off their scent?

### Five Years Forward

Years after the resolution of the case, the PCs find themselves the
subjects of a newly-released, hard-hitting documentary film called Mabus
that claims the PCs interfered with the police investigation and allowed
the Nostradamus killer to pursue his murderous plans. Yet as public
reaction to the movie swells, the PCs begin to receive late-night phone
calls and strange packages, all filled with whispers and notes about
"the real Nostradamus killer." Can they stay away from getting involved
again? Or will they be drawn back to the case when the spotlight shines
so bright upon them?

### Experts of a Sort

The emergence of a serial killer in Portland---the "Ink Man" kidnaps his
victims, tattoos every inch of their body with strange symbols, and then
dumps them near public art installations---leads the Seattle police
department to invite the PCs into a multi-state task force. But after
the initial media circus subsides, a trusted friend within the
department reveals the offer sets them up as scapegoats if the
investigation goes south. Who can the PCs trust? [[Will]] they walk away
from the investigation or allow themselves to be drawn back into the
orbit of a murderous monster?

## Sample Characters

Here are a few characters created just for this Quick Start, ready to
pursue the Nostradamus killer into the dark shadows of Seattle. These
characters assume that the group has chosen Pike's Place Preservation as
their impending issue.## Aisho Hamasaki

Aisho Hamasaki grew up near downtown Seattle, just a few blocks from the
Pike's Place Market, and inherited her family's fish stall when her
parents passed away in 1966. She struggles to keep the stall running
since her son, Hiro, was murdered by the Nostradamus killer last year,
but she has two other kids---Eicho and Ina---who need her more than
ever. She is deeply frustrated by the lack of progress in the case, and
she's starting to contemplate ways to pursue her own investigation.

### Aspects

High Concept: [Struggling Fish Market Vendor] □□□

Trouble: [Involved with Ina's Married English Teacher] □□□

Connection: [Grieving Mother of Hiro Hamasaki] □□□

Relationships: [Oscar Cares About My Son] □□□, [Emily is
Hiding Something] □□□

### SKILLS

Good (+3): Evasion

Fair (+2): Command, [[Provoke]]

Average (+1): [[Contacts]], [[Empathy]], [[Rapport]]

### STUNTS

**Asking Around.** Once per session, you can spend a [[fate point]] to
ensure that another character is not at home when you visit their
residence. If you tie or fail an Evasion roll while sneaking around
inside, however, they arrive home in addition to whatever other costs
you incur.

### CONSEQUENCES

Mild (2) | Moderate (4) | Major (6)

### NOTES

Refresh: 2

### SUSPECT

**Isaac Roberts** □□□

Isaac purchases fish from Aisho each week, his order regular as a clock.
Except, of course, for the two weeks her son was missing. During that
time, the family friend who ran the stall said that Isaac avoided
talking to them, even on days where he had to work in sight of the fish
stall.

Evidence: [Missing Weeks]

## Oscar Garza

Oscar moved to Seattle from Los Angeles with the hopes of getting away
from the violence of South Central and spending more time with his
fiancé Emily, but the recent murders have put him on edge. He was one of
the first people to talk to Caitlyn Ortega at the University of
Washington Medical Center, and---despite his editor's insistence that he
stay focused on the development story of Pike's Place Market---he finds
himself asking more and more questions about the Nostradamus killings
than he knows is wise.

### Aspects

High Concept: [Award-winning Metro Journalist] □□□

Trouble: [Anxious and Afraid] □□□

Connection: [Needs to Get the Story] □□□

Relationships: [Head over Heels for Emily] □□□, [Aisho Knows
More Than She Says] □□□

### SKILLS

Good (+3): [[Empathy]]

Fair (+2): [[Contacts]], [[Physique]]

Average (+1): Cryptography, [[Investigate]], [[Rapport]]

### STUNTS

**In Tune.** You can use [[Empathy]] instead of [[Will]] to resist mental
attacks when you make an effort to understand the reasoning of the
attacks instead of denying them.

### CONSEQUENCES

Mild (2) | Moderate (4) | Major (6)

### NOTES

Refresh: 2

### SUSPECT

**William Richard Winters** □□□

Winters is one of the maintenance staff for the Market, a regular face
around the area that most people trust. Oscar's friend on the police
force has told him that Winters is also one of the prime suspects in the
murders; the police just don't have any evidence at this point.

Evidence: [Inside Source]

## Emily Kane

Emily is an architect working on the Pike's Place Market preservation
plan, one of five architects working for Morgan Ellis, the firm hired by
the city to oversee development of the area. While she's happy on the
surface---her relationship with Oscar is going well and her career is
