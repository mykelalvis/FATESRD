# Escalation Dice

by Brendan Conway

Fate gives a huge amount of power to the PCs. That's a good thing! It's
one of the core appeals of the game---you get to play awesome, cool
characters who are capable and emotionally interesting.

But a side effect of all that power is that sometimes conflict is robbed
of its tension. After all, you're all pretty capable---so if you really
want to win a conflict, you can. The GM could give the opposition high
enough skills, with enough refresh and stunts, to be a bigger challenge,
sure...but that risks tipping the seesaw too much in the other
direction, creating a threat that's insurmountable even with the
advantage of [[fate point]]s. What's more, a foe of such drastic power can
be a frustrating surprise for players who've spent most of the game
expecting to be able to overcome any given threat.

The escalation die system gives you a means to create tension in
conflicts without deeply unbalancing conflicts against PCs or smacking
them with a surprisingly powerful opponent. The system gives the GM
additional resources to use for the opposition in the form of an
_**escalation dice pool**_ kept in front of them during play. This
article describes the core particulars of the system, along with a few
variations you can use at your table.

## Core Escalation Dice System

When using the escalation dice system, the GM sets four fate dice in
front of them. Each one is turned to the - side to start. These are the
GM's escalation dice or, collectively, the GM's escalation dice pool.

On any roll, the GM can swap any number of the dice in the escalation
dice pool for the same number of their own rolled dice. This is a
straight swap---for every one fate die that goes into the escalation
dice pool, another comes out, and vice versa. The GM only ever has four
fate dice in the escalation dice pool at any given time. The GM can
choose to swap a - in the escalation dice pool for a rolled +---thereby
disadvantaging their own roll to store a + in the escalation dice pool
for future use---or, they can swap a + in the escalation dice pool for a
rolled ----thereby bringing up their own roll but depleting their
escalation dice pool.

The GM can't swap dice in the escalation dice pool with dice that the
players rolled.

> During a fight between the PC monster-hunters and a nightmarish
> werewolf, Jack Silverbolt (a PC) fires a silver arrow at the werewolf.
> I roll for the werewolf's defense, and get ++--. I swap one + in my
> roll with a - in my escalation pool, leaving me with a roll of +---
> and an escalation dice pool of +---. If I wanted, I could swap both
> +s out of my roll and into my escalation dice pool, but I don't want
> to go quite that far.

## Variations

The core escalation die mechanic, as presented above, is pretty simple.
That means there are plenty of ways to tweak it for different effects or
specific forms.

### Constant Escalation

In this variant, the escalation dice slowly [[shift]] from - to 0 to+ on
their own. Every time a PC succeeds on a roll, the GM can [[shift]] one die
in the escalation dice pool up a face, from - to 0, or 0 to +. Every
time a PC succeeds with style, the GM can [[shift]] one die in their
escalation dice pool all the way from - to +, or can [[shift]] two separate
dice each up a face.

> Jack Silverbolt has hit the werewolf, with a total of +4 against the
> werewolf's +2. I get to [[shift]] one die in my escalation dice pool up a
> face, leaving me with an escalation dice pool of +0--. Later in the
> same conflict, Ariel Brightblood lands a deadly blow on the werewolf,
> succeeding with style. I decide to [[shift]] one - all the way to a +,
> leaving me with an escalation dice pool of ++0-.

This simple system raises the stakes against the PCs at a much more
constant rate than when the GM can only store + by swapping dice.

### De-escalation

In this variation, every time a PC fails a roll, they get to [[shift]] a die
in the escalation dice pool down one face. Every time a PC accepts a
compel, they get to [[shift]] a die in the escalation dice pool down one
face.

> Jack Silverbolt accepts a compel on his `Dark Hero with Deep
> Compassion] to let the were-cheetah get away while he tries
> to save the life of the monster's innocent victim. Jack's player gets
> to [[shift]] one of my escalation dice down a face, taking a + down to a
> 0. When Jack rolls to apply first aid, he fails, and again gets to
> [[shift]] one of my escalation dice down a face, taking that 0 to a -.

This variation gives players a means to intentionally defuse the
escalation dice pool at a slow rate---by pursuing compels or by engaging
with challenges that are beyond their skills.

### Passive Opposition and Escalation Dice

In this variation, the GM can spend dice out of the escalation dice pool
to elevate passive difficulty. Any time the PCs are up against a passive
difficulty, the GM can spend one escalation die set to a + by turning it
to a - and raising the passive difficulty by 1.

Since the GM sets all passive difficulties, it may seem pointless to
allow them to also boost the passive difficulty of dangerous actions
with the escalation dice. The objective with this variation is to give
the GM a valve by which to justify making the passive difficulties
higher. The GM still has to initially judge the situation based on the
fiction, but can then choose to amp up the tension by spending
escalation dice, if they desire.

> Ariel Brightblood is trying to cast a complicated magic ritual, and
> fast. I set the difficulty at Great (+4) to start, because of the
> situation. But then I decide that this is a tense moment, and I want
> to make it even more so. I spend an escalation dice out of my pool,
> changing it from + to -, and raise the passive difficulty by +1 to
> Superb (+5).

Use this variation if you want to give the GM an additional way to use
escalation dice, outside of just using them in conflicts or with active
opposition.

### Conflict Escalation

In this variation, the escalation dice pool directly modifies the rolls
of the NPCs throughout each conflict. This is a deeper change to the
core escalation dice pool mechanics than the other variations. In this
variation, the GM can no longer swap dice between their escalation dice
pool and their rolls. Instead, their escalation dice pool only changes
when PCs either succeed or fail, as per the Constant Escalation and
De-escalation variants.

When using this variation, in conflicts---and only in conflicts---the GM
adds the full total of their escalation dice pool to every roll they
make.

> My escalation dice pool is ++0-, for a total of +1. Ariel Brightblood
> is engaged in a duel with the terrifying Baron von Sanguinus. When she
> attacks the Baron with an opening salvo of thrown silver blades, I add
> the escalation dice pool total to the Baron's defense roll. I succeed
> in my defense, which means Ariel fails in her attack, and gets to
> [[shift]] one of the escalation dice down a face. Her player takes the +
> down to 0. Then, when Baron von Sanguinus attacks her in turn using
> his deadly blood-rapier, I still add the total of the escalation dice
> pool. But the pool is now +00-, so that total is +0.

This variation makes the escalation dice far more consistently
important, and removes the need for the GM to make a decision about when
to use them. Because they modify every GM roll, they also have a natural
balancing mechanic. As the escalation dice pool becomes stronger (with
more and more +), the GM succeeds more, and the PCs fail---thereby
de-escalating the dice in the pool. If the escalation dice pool is ever
too low, then the GM's roll fails, and the PC succeeds, thereby bringing
the escalation dice pool back up.

### Conflict Duration

This variation is meant to push PCs to try to end the conflict as
quickly as possible. When using this variation, at the start of every
round of conflict, the GM can [[shift]] one escalation die to a +.

> It's the start of a new conflict between Jack Silverbolt and the
> Creature of the Abyssal Depths. My escalation dice pool is +00-. I
> immediately get to [[shift]] one die all the way to +, so I [[shift]] the -,
> leaving my pool with ++00. Once every character has taken an action
> (and I haven't swapped any dice into or out of the pool), we start a
> new round of the conflict, and I again get to [[shift]] one die all the
> way to +, leaving me with an escalation dice pool of +++0.

This variation gives PCs a strong incentive to try to end a conflict as
quickly as possible. Over the course of the conflict, the escalation
pool is likely to get stronger, and slowly wear them down, if given the
chance. They are instead incentivized to spend their resources to win up
front, or to concede.### Combining Variations: Conflict Duration and Conflict Escalation

You can combine these two variations easily to provide a very, very
intense conflict escalation system. Every round of conflict, the GM gets
to set one of their escalation dice to +, and then adds all their
escalation dice to every roll they make, just like the normal Conflict
Escalation variant. The net result is that a lengthy conflict may very
well get utterly overwhelming for PCs, laying an even stronger emphasis
upon either ending the conflict quickly or conceding. In the right
tone---say, the kind of game in which the odds should be meaningfully
stacked against the PCs---the system might provide exactly the right
kind of intensity.### Escalation Surges

This variation gives the pool additional effects, beyond just changing
the results of rolls. It makes the specific die faces matter still
further.

If the escalation dice pool is ever showing one of the following
combinations, the players can choose to _**spend**_ all the dice,
resetting the pool to ----, to introduce that effect. The GM can do
the same by spending a [[fate point]]. So PCs might want to deplete the
escalation die pool to diminish their opposition, but will have to
suffer some fictional setback to do it.

---

**If the escalation pool is...**   **...then you can spend all the dice in the pool to make a PC:**
++++                                Concede a conflict immediately; the other side gets to demand a major concession, and the PCs receive no additional benefit.
+++0                                Concede a conflict immediately; the PCs still get to set the terms, but they receive no additional benefit.
+++-                            Take a consequence, moderate or higher.
++00                                Accept a compel without receiving a [[fate point]]; if they wish to resist the compel, they can just leave the escalation die pool as is.

> I've managed to get my escalation dice pool up to ++++ over the course
> of an epic battle between the Wraithataur and the two PCs, Jack
> Silverbolt and Ariel Brightblood. They're still in the fight, but
> Jack's player eyes that escalation dice pool warily, and decides to do
> something about it. They concede the conflict. But since the dice were
> at ++++, Jack and Ariel don't get any additional benefit, and they
> have to acquiesce to a major concession from the Wraithataur. I
> propose that the concession is the Wraithataur getting its hooves on
> the Dream Medallion they were protecting, and Jack and Ariel's players
> agree. The conflict ends with the Wraithataur escaping, Dream
> Medallion in its maw, but the escalation dice pool stands at ----.

Follow the normal procedures for concessions and compels, with the
exceptions to the process noted above. If the PCs take a consequence,
work together to decide exactly what form that consequence takes,
fitting the fiction.

This variation incentivizes the players to disadvantage themselves to
defuse the escalation dice pool. It puts more pressure on some options
in Fate that can be overlooked, and leads to more complicated,
consequential fiction in your game.

## Escalating Your Game

Keep in mind the tone of your game when deciding whether to use
escalation dice at all, or to use any of the variants. This system
increases the odds against the PCs, making things just a bit harder on
them. It lends more tension to your conflicts, and makes it more likely
that the PCs will have to deal with failure or defeat. If you're not
interested in a Fate game that puts more pressure on the PCs, then this
probably isn't for you.

But if you want to play Fate with more emphasis on tension and pressure
on the PCs, this system gives you what you're looking for. Experiment
with the variations to get the right mix of tension and pressure for
your game, and always keep an eye on finding just the right balance for
your particular game.
