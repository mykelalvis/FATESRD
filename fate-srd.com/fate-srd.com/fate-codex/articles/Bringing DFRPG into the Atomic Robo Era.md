# Bringing DFRPG into the Atomic Robo Era

by [[Heather Beauregard]]

A lot has happened in the world of Fate over the three years since the
Dresden Files Roleplaying Game (DFRPG) was first released. Bringing Fate
Core and the four actions into DFRPG---along with some necessary changes
to skills, the addition of boosts, and a few balance tweaks to
spellcasting and shields---will breathe new life into an old campaign.
For the truly adventurous, a full conversion to the Atomic Robo Fate
system will give you brand new ways to use Thaumaturgy and redefine
magic by tying it to your modes instead of your mental stress.

Much like a certain private-eye wizard, it's high time Changes came to
DFRPG.

In this essay, we'll walk through all the steps needed to make the
journey into the Atomic Robo era of Fate. To get the most out of it you
should have some familiarity with DFRPG; more detailed explanations of
all the terminology can be found in DFRPG: Your Story. Page references
read as follows: (YS - Your Story); (FC - [[Fate Core]]); (AR - Atomic
Robo).

## [[Fate Core]]: Translating the Four Actions

The first step to any Core update of the Dresden Files RPG is to
implement the four actions. Nearly all skills in DFRPG can translate
directly to their Core counterparts, with a few exceptions we'll discuss
later. Assessments and declarations become [[create advantage]] actions.
Replace tags with boosts.

Maneuvers are [[create advantage]] actions. For any [[create advantage]] or
[[overcome]] actions involving teamwork, one character makes the skill roll,
then adds one to the roll result for each character assisting who has at
least +1 in the skill being rolled.

In DFRPG, taking a block action lets you set up a value of [[shift]]s that
must be overcome to take a specific action; blocks also tie into the
grapple rules. Blocking is an old action that is no longer supported by
Core, though, so remove it. The main uses for blocking are to set up a
secondary defense for weaker characters or to create cover, and you can
still do either of those things by using the standard create advantage
action.

Grappling, another subsystem of DFRPG, has its own problems, mainly that
supernaturally strong characters can do a lot of damage with it while
preventing any retaliation. It tends to slow the game down and takes
multiple turns to set up. Remove grappling and give characters who have
Strength powers (YS183-184) +2 instead of +1 to [[Physique]] rolls when
creating grapple-style advantages like `In a Headlock] or
`Pinned].

Supplemental actions are another relic of older versions of Fate. They
allow you to take a -1 to your roll in order to do a secondary thing
like move one zone during your turn or draw your weapon before firing
it. These no longer exist in [[Fate Core]], since movement across a zone is
free, and characters are assumed to have themselves ready unless some
situation prevents them (like being tied up).

One more thing has to go, and that's combined actions. In DFRPG, these
let you do two actions at once by modifying your main skill roll by the
value of a secondary skill. Generally in Core, if you need to do several
things at once you're looking at a challenge (FC147-149), so play it out
to the fullest!

Weapon and armor ratings remain unchanged from DFRPG. Use the standard
attack action from Core, but with one difference: if you tie on an
attack action, you gain the boost only if you don't deal any stress.

### Skills: The Big Squish

This is the meat of the conversion to Core and is meant to give GMs a
basic checklist to follow. If you're starting a new campaign, make sure
to tell your players about these changes in advance!

If you're converting an existing campaign, keep the skill ladder.
Switching to the skill pyramid mid-game can make it difficult to retain
the essence of a character. If you're starting a new campaign, use the
pyramid. Your characters will have fewer high ranked skills though, so
create your encounters accordingly.

The older DFRPG skills Might and Endurance have been combined into
[[Physique]]. Use this to determine the number of physical stress boxes a
character has.

Replace Intimidation from DFRPG with [[Provoke]] from Core. It has a much
wider scope.

Remove Performance and Survival. These skills can reasonably be covered
by [[Rapport]] and [[Empathy]] or [[Physique]] and [[Stealth]], respectively.

Use [[Will]] for any True Faith powers (YS187-188) that would normally use
Conviction.

Conviction and Discipline are a special case. These skills have been
combined into [[Will]] in Core, but due to how magic works in DFRPG we need
to introduce a new skill for controlling magic: Spellcasting.

### For All the Wizards in the Audience

For those new to DFRPG or who haven't played in a while, Evocation in
DFRPG works like this:

Before rolling you choose the strength of your spell, up to your
Conviction rating. Then you roll your Discipline to determine if you can
control your magic or not. If you succeed, your damage includes the
strength of the spell as weapon damage. So a character with high
Conviction can cast very powerful spells, but without high Discipline he
can't control them, and he can either take backlash (stress damage equal
to the failure) or fallout (letting the failure create a negative scene
aspect and reducing his roll).

Evocation is a lot of fun and we want to keep it that way, so to fill
the gap left by Conviction, introduce this skill:### Spellcasting

The Spellcasting skill represents the strength of your will, and affects
your ability to summon magic both offensively and defensively.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Using magic to destroy objects, remove barriers, and
change scene aspects.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Introducing scene aspects, cast a Shield, cast
Wards.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Hexing and Counterspells use Spellcasting directly, but you
need the Evocation power to deal stress damage with elemental magic.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Spellcasting is not used for traditional defense, but can be
used to create Shields.

### Addressing Wizard Supremacy

Magic in DFRPG is extremely powerful, so much so that it's often
beneficial to stack up a bunch of advantages for your wizard and just
let him one-shot anything that comes at you. It can make encounter
design difficult to balance, especially for a new GM. Here are a few
optional changes you can make to get those pesky wizard players using
their brains instead of just their fireballs:

- Limit Refinement (YS182) to +1 in any given stat. This leads to
  well-rounded characters instead of wizards who try to solve every
  problem by setting it on fire.
- Remove focus items and have everyone use their refunded points to
  create magic items and potions. Focus items are purely stat bonuses
  on a class of character that doesn't need them and they rarely get
  mentioned in play. Magic items and potions are tools that define how
  a character can approach a problem, and players love finding
  creative uses for them. (See "Crafting", YS278-281.)
- Spending mental stress past your Spellcasting rating should be a
  tough decision instead of the norm. To do this, you need to take a
  second hit on your mental stress track for the value of the extra
  [[shift]]s. Casting a bigger spell now means casting fewer spells later.
  (See "Evocation: How to Do it," YS250-251.)### Shields: How do they work, again?

Shields used to be magical blocks; with blocks removed, we need to
rethink how they work.

A Shield is an Evocation-based full defense that costs one mental
stress. Make a Spellcasting roll at +2, as usual for a full defense. If
an attack manages to inflict enough [[shift]]s to overcome your armor, the
shield breaks and you cannot block attacks with it anymore. This spell
lasts until it is dropped or broken at no additional stress cost, but
you cannot take any action except defense while it's active.

> An acid-spitting snake monster is closing in on Warden Rick, and his
> friends are still on the way. He puts up a shield to stall for time.
> He marks one mental stress and rolls his Spellcasting, and gets a
> result of 4! +2 means he's got a defense of 6, and Armor:6 against
> whatever the snake spits at him.

Characters who like to play defensively might take Spellcasting stunts
like these:

- _Reflexive Shielding:_ Use Spellcasting to defend against physical
  or elemental attacks. (This does not cost mental stress.)
- _Stand Behind Me!:_ Once per turn an ally in the same zone can use
  your shield defense instead of rolling their own.

## The Portal to the Future

[[Fate Core]] bolts onto DFRPG much like a new hood bolts onto the Blue
Beetle, but for those of you who can't help but upgrade to the latest
and greatest system that's out, this is where it gets fun. Atomic Robo
is the first post-Core system that preserves everything good from DFRPG
while having its own unique style. Finally, we can bring magic items
into the next century through mega-stunts and get rid of that
old-fashioned mental stress limit so that spellcasters are free to
create whatever advantage they want, with the [[fate point]]s to spare!

This portion of the essay requires some familiarity with creating
characters in Atomic Robo RPG, as many of the systems present are brand
new to [[Fate Core]].

### Magic Ã  la Modes

Define a new weird mode for spellcasters and supernatural characters,
called Magical by default. (See "Getting Weird," AR70-72.) Players are
encouraged to rename this to Wizard, or White Court, or whatever they'd
like. This is a reskinned version of the Science mode. Like any other
weird mode, this one must be justified by your concept.

The Magical mode costs 3 points and includes [[Will]], [[Notice]], and [[Lore]] as a
base. The Magical mode should also include any skill that the player
wishes to use when they cast magic or use supernatural powers: Combat if
they want to fight, [[Stealth]] for veils, [[Empathy]] to affect emotions, etc.
Add the cost of these additional skills to the overall cost of the mode
by using the table on AR72.

A Magical mode might look like this:

> WARDEN: [[Athletics]], Combat, [[Contacts]], [[Notice]], [[Physique]], [[Will]], [[Lore]]
> (total cost: 9)

This character can use his magic to dodge, fight, cast shields, use
magical communication, lift heavy things, resist compulsion, or have a
book about vampires. But he doesn't have [[Stealth]], so he can't cast
veils! Magical ability is tied to modes in this way because wizards in
the Dresdenverse have clear strengths and weaknesses, and no one can do
everything. This maintains that same idea without having to use mental
stress as a limiter.

You might have noticed [[Lore]] in the example. This [[Lore]] skill is a bit
different from the [[Lore]] skill in DFRPG. This variant is a new weird
Science skill that includes any kind of knowledge or field of study that
pertains to the supernatural. You can specialize in different fields of
[[Lore]] just like a Science skill (e.g., [[Lore]]: Portals, or [[Lore]]: Faerie
Courts). [[Lore]] can be used to [[create advantage]] and overcome. (See
"Science, It's Special," AR69.)

Note that [[Lore]] doesn't replace Science and it's perfectly valid for a
character to have both. A doctor might have Science: Medicine and [[Lore]]:
Holy Objects and that's okay!### [[Lore]]

Every [[Lore]] skill other than [[Notice]] and [[Will]] has the following actions
and applications:

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Know things and solve problems related to the area of
magic in question.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: You can create or discover details or aspects
by relying on your knowledge of magic, perhaps by searching through
forbidden tomes or remembering what you learned as an apprentice. This
lets you determine the hidden weaknesses of monsters (`Allergic to
Inherited Silver!]), figure out how to summon a Faerie Queen
(`By Name and Blood and Deed...]), or outsmart a sphinx in a
riddle game (`It's Always the Left Door]).### Combat Is Combat

Evocation in DFRPG was limited by mental stress because of how powerful
it is on a per-turn basis. In Atomic Robo, throwing a fireball is just
the same as attacking with a gun or a sword. You cast magic to attack by
rolling Combat if it's in your Magical mode. To specialize and increase
the power of your magic you can take an Evocation stunt or a mega-stunt.
But remember, in Atomic Robo instead of reducing your own [[fate point]]s to
become more powerful, you give the GM more [[fate point]]s to use against
you!

Wizards in the Dresdenverse tend to favor one element over another, so
an Evocation stunt might look like this:

- _Combat Wizardry:_ +1 to Combat when attacking with water magic. +1
  to Combat when defending with spirit magic.
- _One with Nature:_ +1 to creating an advantage with Combat or
  [[Athletics]] when you borrow an element that's present in the scene
  (water from the nearby river, wind from a ceiling fan, fire from a
  burning building...).

### Supernatural Stunts

Powers in DFRPG are priced to come in packages depending on the template
you choose to play. There's no such restriction in Atomic Robo, so you
can be more specific. Remember that your ability to use magic or turn
into a wolf or be a sexy vampire comes from your modes and concept, so
you don't need to take a stunt unless you want to focus on that aspect
of your character. This is a big change from DFRPG where you followed a
template of powers, and it's one of the big draws of Atomic Robo. Think
of it like this: If your character's concept is `Nerdy Teenage
Werewolf], then yep, you can turn into a wolf. But unless you
take a stunt that makes you better at fighting as a wolf, you won't be
any better at it than you were as a nerdy teenager. Stunts are the meat
that fleshes out your concept.

Everyone who's not completely human in DFRPG dips into four physical
powers: Speed, Strength, Toughness, and Recovery. These powers are
fairly easy to reproduce via Robo's basic mega-stunts (AR76) and even
come with built-in catches. Here are some examples of the four powers as
mega-stunts. You can cut or add additional benefits to any of these (see
AR80 for guidelines).

- _Supernatural Speed:_ (YS178) You're absolutely faster than any
  mortal, but you are weak to **_**. In a physical conflict, you
  always act first. +1 to [[Athletics]] when defending or overcoming
  obstacles. You can move two zones per turn freely instead of one. (4
  benefits)
- _Supernatural Strength:_ (YS183) You're absolutely stronger than any
  mortal, but at a cost. +2 to overcoming with [[Physique]] when you're
  using your strength to lift or break something. +2 weapon damage
  when you can bring your strength to bear. (3 benefits)
- _Inhuman Toughness:_ (YS185) You're bulletproof, but weak to
  ____. You have +1 armor against physical attacks. (2 benefits)
- _Inhuman Recovery:_ (YS185) Once per scene, spend a [[fate point]] to
  reduce one of your consequences by a degree of severity (severe to
  major, major to mild, mild to nothing). +2 to overcome rolls made to
  recover from a physical consequence. (2 benefits)

Mega-stunts, like the Magical mode, need to be justified by the
character's concept. A werewolf might be absolutely stronger than a
mortal man, but scares the pants off everyone when he hulks out. Or a
Red Court vampire might be bulletproof but weak to sunlight.

### Magical Hardware

Magic items from DFRPG can translate into identical pieces of hardware
in Robo, or an item can even gain more significance by making it into a
mega-stunt and giving it function and flaw aspects. Rather than basing a
character's artisanship on their Crafting skill, you simply pay for
items out of your stunt budget, which opens up all kinds of new avenues
for players with signature items. A mega-stunt can even cover several
items at a time, or an empty potion slot can be defined in play, just
like it can in DFRPG. Here are some examples to get you started:

_Empty Bottle:_ Use [[Lore]]: Artifacts instead of another skill to use a
potion or simple device. Gain +2 to the effect if you make it ahead of
time with a montage instead of declaring on the spot. Once used, you may
regain the use of this stunt whenever you have some downtime to tinker
or make a brief shopping trip. (1 benefit)

#### Megastunt: Warden Sword

- Function: Silver Spellbreaker
- Flaw: Weight of a Reputation

+2 to overcome with [[Will]] when dispelling hostile magic. +2 to counter
attempts to [[create advantage]] against you with magic. (2 benefits)

### The Challenge of Thaumaturgy

Atomic Robo has fairly standard rules for conflicts and contests, just
like DFRPG, but they've also added something new to the mix---the
challenge (FC147)---and it's perfect for thaumaturgy. A challenge occurs
when a group of players wants to achieve a goal that's fairly complex
but isn't combat (though some combat may occur). The GM runs the
challenge as a series of [[overcome]] actions, each one using a different
skill, and narrating the events as they unfold. Players can create
advantages during the challenge, though if they fail then they're no
closer to their goal and often give their enemies a bonus.

Thaumaturgy challenges might involve obtaining foci or sympathetic
links, finding the right place to cast your spell, or simply having the
willpower to hold a difficult spell together. The best part is any
player can participate in the challenge, and it doesn't have to be just
the wizard's show.

If you have a particularly tricky spell in mind, a challenge can help
you put a spotlight on it and make it into a full event that can either
go perfectly to plan or horribly wrong. A potion might need to be kept
at a certain temperature while you chant an invocation in Sanskrit and
add three drops of salamander oil at precisely the right intervals or it
might explode. (Or worse, not be powerful enough to melt through the
bars of the Winter Queen's ice prison like it was supposed to.) That's
assuming you're left to the task and no one shows up to either stop or
"help" you....

### Optional Stunts: Soulgaze, The Sight, Hexing, and Lawbreaker

These optional stunts are available to any character with a concept and
Magical mode that justify them, and don't count against their stunt
total. The double-edged sword is already included. If your Magical mode
is rated at +2 or better, you must take Hexing. All of these stunts can
also be included as part of a larger mega-stunt if further bonuses are
desired.

- _Soulgaze:_ When you initiate a Soulgaze by looking into the eyes of
  someone with a mortal soul for the first time, begin a contest. Each
  of you rolls an attack of [[Empathy]] to overcome a defense roll of
  [[Will]]. You each reveal your concepts to the other, and as a result of
  the roll, you will each reveal one additional aspect. If the
  attacker wins, the defender reveals either a weakness or a relevant
  aspect. If defender wins, then the defender chooses which additional
  aspect is revealed. Treat a tie as if the attacker made a successful
  attack. A success with style grants an additional free invoke on the
  revealed aspect or weakness. Note: Soulgazing involves two rolls, so
  each character serves as the attacker and defender once.
- _The Sight:_ For a [[fate point]], you may open your third eye and
  initiate a contest known as the Sight. During your next turn, roll
  [[Notice]] against a difficulty set by the GM to reveal an aspect on
  your target. (The more stressful a situation is, the higher the
  difficulty should be.) You must then defend against that same
  difficulty with [[Will]] in order to close your third eye or proceed to
  the next round. A success with style on the [[Notice]] roll reveals two
  aspects. You may continue the contest for as many rounds as you like
  to reveal more aspects, but the difficulty increases by 1 each turn.
  Failing to defend with [[Will]] results in taking mental stress equal to
  the failure, but the Sight does not end until you defend
  successfully or are taken out.- _Hexing:_ You may deliberately hex electrical devices by rolling
  your Magical mode's strength against a difficulty set by the GM
  (YS258-259). If you succeed, you disable the device; if you fail you
  can still choose to disable the device, but at a cost. The GM can
  compel your Magical mode aspect to cause this effect to
  automatically succeed when it would be inconvenient.- _(First, Second, Third, etc.) Lawbreaker:_ When you break a Law of
  Magic (YS232-246) you automatically take this stunt. You gain +1 to
  any deliberate action that may lead to a repeated breaking of the
  law, at a cost. One of your aspects must change to reflect the
  damage you've done to yourself and others. The third occurrence
  replaces this stunt with Repeat Offender: the bonus increases to +2,
  and another of your aspects is corrupted. A corrupted aspect is
  always the most relevant for the purpose of a Soulgaze.

### Looking to the Future

Fate is an ever-evolving system and there's more Dresden Files RPG on
the way with the upcoming The Paranet Papers and Dresden Files:
Accelerated Edition. I want to thank everyone who helped beta test both
the [[Fate Core]] and the Atomic Robo conversions, and I hope that my
table's experiences with DFRPG can bring a little fuego! to yours.
