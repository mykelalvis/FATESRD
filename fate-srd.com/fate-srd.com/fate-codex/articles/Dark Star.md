## The Dark Star

Sitting at the edge of the galaxy, beyond which there is nothing---not
even the vacuum of space---lies the Dark Star. It's large, nearly the
size of a planet, but it has no mass. It emits no light, absorbing
whatever strikes it without growing in size or density. No sensor can
penetrate it. All probes that are sent into it cease to function
immediately upon entering the sphere.

Technically, the mysterious sphere is called Object 7232B. Everyone who
works at Outpost 7232B-a and the garrison of Imperial soldiers that's
been assigned to protect that Outpost call it the Dark Star, even on
official reports to the Imperial Academy of Sciences on the Core
planets.### Quick Start Adventures

Dark Star is a Quick Start Adventure that contains a unique setting,
pregenerated characters, plot hooks, and an opening scene. It's not a
full adventure, but it will get your group started on a brand new Fate
campaign!### The Galactic Empire

For the last 673 years, humanity has been united under the Galactic
Empire, a fusion of cultures and peoples that brought a _Pax Imperia_ to
bear on the problems of the galaxy. While individual personalities and
cultures have risen and fallen, the Empire has remained in control,
spreading throughout the galaxy to ensure that humanity is the dominant
form of life. There have been other, nonhuman species found, but it is
broadly considered to be indigenous life and confined to local planetary
systems---the stars belong to Terra.

### _The Victorious_

The primary power of the Empire is found in its capital ships, massive
hulks of military force capable of jumping across the galaxy at
faster-than-light speeds. The Empire has nearly a hundred of these
vessels, each capable of projecting force across an entire system and
launching fighters to defend itself from serious threats. They are
filled with thousands of soldiers, dozens of pilots, and enough weaponry
to bombard planetary forces into dust.

To protect its interests in the Dark Star, the Empire has assigned an
older, nearly decommissioned capital ship named _The Victorious_ to
ensure that security is maintained in the vicinity of Outpost 7232B-a.
There are no other planets in the system, but the Dark Star itself
creates enough gravity to act as a kind of phantom planet, surrounded by
an asteroid field and a few small moons. This is _The Victorious'_ final
mission, babysitting a scientific phenomenon at the edge of an empire.## The Victorious

### Aspects

**High Concept:** `Dark Star Mission Escort]
**Trouble:** `Scheduled for Decommission]

### Stress

□□□□

### Consequences

Mild (2) • Moderate (4) • Major (6)

### Notes

_The Victorious_ uses the Ship Skills found in this chapter.### Ace Pilots on the Edge

Along with _The Victorious_, the Empire has stationed nearly three dozen ace fighter pilots to run scientific and defensive missions along the perimeter of the Dark Star, collected in three distinct squadrons (Red, Green, and Blue). After an early mission with ordinary pilots turned into a disaster---the pilots were unable to cope with the Dark Star's rotating gravity well and crashed into a fighter transport---the Empire was forced to send more qualified pilots out to Outpost 7232B-a, hotshots who can roll with the shifting conditions and get the scientists the data they need.

Of course, the Empire needs good pilots in the Core. Anyone sent out to the Dark Star likely has some damage or problems associated with their service---a criminal conviction hanging over their head maybe or a failure to obey protocols at appropriate levels. Simply put, these are good pilots and terrible soldiers, troublemakers who don't fit in anywhere else in the galaxy. Any pilot assigned to the Dark Star has problems, reasons that they aren't welcome back in the Core.

### The White Hawk Rebellion

The last five years have put a real strain on the flow of pilots out to the Dark Star. An outbreak of insurrection called the White Hawk Rebellion---launched by a zealous religious faction on Vralae II---has led to a full-on Galactic Civil War across multiple systems, including the Core worlds. Many of the Empire's capital ships have been captured (or have defected) and the fighting between the White Hawk rebels and the Empire is intensifying as the rebels bring the weight of their forces to bear. It's not clear who will win. Each day that ace pilots are stationed at the Dark Star instead of back in the Core is a day that a lesser pilot faces the guns of the White Hawk fleet in defense of the Empire.

## Setting Creation

As a Quick Start Adventure, _**Dark Star**_ has everything you need to jump right into your first session. Before you start, you'll want to discuss the broader setting with your group, perhaps even reading aloud the descriptions of the Dark Star, the Galactic Empire, _The Victorious_ and her fighter pilots, and the Rebellion so everyone is on the same page.

At the start of play, explain the **current issue** to your players and ask them to fill in one or two additional faces associated with _**The Dark Star**_. These additional characters will provide new plot hooks and twists that will tie your players more deeply to the strange phenomena they face at the edge of the galaxy.

Then ask your players to choose from one of the two available **impending issues**: `White Hawks Approach] or `Growing Scientist Discontent]. Have them fill in one or two additional faces for their chosen impending issue as well, rounding out the larger cast of characters with their suggestions.

### Current Issue: The Dark Star

Pilots who fly Dark Star sorties have to contend with a few major problems: the science missions that require them to get close to the object's weird gravitational field and the occasional Void Craver ship that jumps into the system. In the case of the former, most pilots know their limits around the Dark Star and refuse to fly missions that are too dangerous, but the Void Cravers, an apocalyptic cult that seeks oneness with the Dark Star, don't care about safety. They rush at the strange object, engines pushed to full to be at one with their gods, daring Imperial pilots to try to intervene. The Empire has given orders to "shoot to kill" on any unidentified craft that move toward the Dark Star, but no pilot likes lighting up civilian transports, no matter where the transport is headed.

Most pilots run their science missions with a constant eye on ship contacts, hoping that they aren't going to pull any Void Cravers on this run...

**Faces:**

- Rustin Jeranti, Matriarch of the apocalyptic cult seeking oneness   with the Dark Star

- Captain Rylnn Reznik, commander of _The Victorious_

### Impending Issues

In addition to The Dark Star and the threat it poses, there are a number of other impending issues that threaten _The Victorious_, including:

#### White Hawks Approach

The fight against the White Hawk insurgency has mostly taken place near Core planets, key strategic systems that the rebels have tried to separate from the rest of the Empire. Recently, pilots have caught wind of a second front in the War, a White Hawk fleet that's rumored to be near the Dark Star. No one knows if the rebels think the Dark Star has strategic value, but rebel ace Kir Heartstar is rumored to be piloting a fighter in the fleet closest to _The Victorious_. Kir's presence indicates that the insurgency is plotting something, as they wouldn't waste one of their best pilots on a mission that wasn't vital to their cause.

**Faces:**

- Kir Heartstar, ace White Hawk pilot in approaching rebel fleet

- Master Chief Granderson, hanger chief assigned to Blue Squadron

#### Growing Scientist Discontent

Over the past six weeks, the head astrophysicist, Dr. Tanya Lee, assigned to research the Dark Star, has claimed that micro-G movements inside Object 7232B are indicative of "a future Dark Star event." The other scientists associated with the project---and scientists back in the Core---have been unable to replicate Dr. Lee's results, leading to a reprimand from _The Victorious'_ political officer, Lt. Elias Karisa. Undaunted by the political pressure, Dr. Lee has taken to publishing scientific memos demanding more funding and support for "Dark Star oriented research."

## Character Creation

_**Dark Star**_ works best with [[Fate Core]] characters. You can choose to use Fate Accelerated approaches instead of the more traditional skills, but the unique **ship skills** for the fighters won't seem as interesting or special if the players already think about their actions
abstractly.

In _**Dark Star**_, players take on the roles of ace Imperial fighter pilots, assigned to the farthest reaches of the galaxy as the result of bad luck and poor choices. It's possible for players to take on the roles of scientists or other military officers on board _The Victorious_, but such characters probably won't have as direct a role in the story if they don't have a fighter in the dogfights.

Players should select their aspects as normal, choosing a high concept, a trouble, and completing the phase trio to determine their final three aspects. Players should also select a **callsign** for their pilot, such as Coyote, Hotdog, Viper, or Apollo. These callsigns aren't aspects, but they are a great way to reflect how the NPCs in the setting view the characters. Most of the players will portray characters associated with Blue Squadron, one of the oldest serving units aboard _The Victorious_, and they may even choose to serve in the same three-fighter unit, a flight of ships like Blue 10, Blue 11, and Blue 12.### Pregenerated Characters

If your players wish to play pregenerated Dark Star pilots, you can use `the three sample characters provided in this adventure](#Anchor-4). Stats are provided only for [[Fate Core]] versions of each character, including their individual stunts, callsigns, and fighter ship extras.

### Skill List

_**Dark Star**_ uses a modified skill list from traditional [[Fate Core]]. These skills aren't new, but they've been renamed and contextualized to ensure that they make sense for the new setting. The other skills ([[Athletics]], [[Contacts]], [[Deceive]], [[Empathy]], [[Fight]], [[Investigate]], [[Physique]], [[Provoke]], [[Rapport]], [[Resources]], [[Shoot]], [[Stealth]], and [[Will]]) remain unchanged.

#### Doctrine ([[Lore]])

Imperial officers receive training in both the history of the Empire and the standard operating procedures of the Imperial military. For some, this knowledge allows them to bypass paperwork and locate resources within Imperial ships and structures. Other pilots haven't thought about Imperial doctrine since flight school and struggle to access records properly, know what's expected in proper protocol, or remember the layout of a particular kind of ship.

#### Larceny ([[Burglary]])

Pilots don't often case banks or break into people's houses, but that doesn't mean they're unfamiliar with the art of getting what they want through illicit means. Pickpocketing, stealing, and breaking into places all fall under the art of Larceny, but it more frequently involves fudging paperwork and altering computer records without getting caught.

#### Operate ([[Drive]])

Most Imperial soldiers don't have much occasion to drive a vehicle, but they regularly operate a variety of Imperial equipment, including computers on board various ships. Sometimes this includes driving a vehicle on the planet's surface. Operate does not include piloting a fighter or commanding a capital ship (see Ship Skills for more on ships in _**Dark Star**_).

#### Repair (Craft)

More often than not, Imperial crews are asked to fix up equipment on the fly, repairing old tech to keep it running. Pilots often repair broken equipment on their own ships, although some prefer to leave that work to a Master Chief on deck. Characters with Repair are able to fix broken tech, jury rig new equipment, and generally keep things running on Imperial ships. Note that this does not include on-the-fly adjustments to fighters during dogfights (see `Systems](#Anchor-6)).

#### Survival ([[Notice]])

_**Dark Star**_ makes use of `the Survival skill found in this issue](../changing-skills-matter-survival/index.html). In addition to overcoming environmental dangers and making use of information characters notice in their environments, Survival can also help pilots navigate zero-G and find resources in emergency situations. 

### Automatic Discovery

Since [[Notice]] has been removed from the skill list, _**Dark Star**_ makes use of the `Automatic Discovery system developed by Ryan Macklin for use with Survival](../changing-skills-matter-survival/index.html). Skills rated at Good (+3) or higher automatically succeed at rolls to overcome or create advantages using passive discovery; skills rated at Great (+4) or higher automatically succeed with style on such rolls.

### Conditions

Rather than use stress tracks, _**Dark Star**_ uses modified conditions from the Fate System Toolkit (page 18) in addition to the more traditional consequences. Pilots have a single stress box for two sticky conditions called Angry and Exhausted and two stress boxes for a lasting condition called Injured.

#### Using Conditions in Play

During play, you can mark off conditions to avoid being taken out during a conflict or to pay a minor or major cost as the result of a failed roll, provided it's in keeping with the fiction of the story. It's pretty tough to say you're _**Injured**_ as the result of a failed roll against your superior officer...unless that superior officer decides to attack you for your insolence.

When the condition is checked, it acts as an aspect on the character---it can be invoked and compelled as normal by the GM and other players until it's recovered. In the case of conditions with more than one stress box, the condition doesn't act as an aspect until all the stress boxes associated with that condition are checked. Checking just one box of Injured, for example, doesn't do anything. It's the second (or third) checked box that puts the aspect on the character.

!`](https://sites/default/files/images/codex/v1issue2/conditions.png)

#### Sticky Conditions: Angry and Exhausted

Sticky conditions in Dark Star act as aspects when you check them off to pay a minor cost or avoid being taken out in a scene. These conditions last until you have accepted a compel (or self-compelled) in accordance with the condition. If you blow a social encounter, for example, because you're too _**Angry**_ to listen to another pilot, then you can recover the condition as you get your head screwed on straight.

#### Lasting Conditions: Injured

Lasting conditions are more difficult to get rid of during play. Instead of accepting a compel, you must wait a whole session and then make a recovery roll against the injury with a Great (+4) passive difficulty. For example, a character might have to visit the Medical Bay and make use of the Operate skill to apply medical attention to the wound in question. If no characters have the needed skills, it might be possible to steal medical supplies (Larceny), convince a ship doctor to see you ([[Rapport]]), or even try to heal the injury without passing out ([[Will]]).

#### Additional Stress Boxes for Conditions

Characters with a [[Physique]] at Fair (+2) or better can add one stress box to Exhausted, and characters with a [[Will]] of Fair (+2) or better can add one stress box to Angry. Characters with either [[Physique]] or [[Will]] at Great (+4) can add a third box to Injured. These additional boxes do not slow or delay recovery. If a player accepts a compel or makes an overcome roll, the entire track clears.

### New Extra: Ships

In addition to their normal skills and aspects, pilots in Dark Star get their ship as an extra. Most pilots who serve on a capital ship like _The Victorious_ customize and modify their fighters, swapping out parts and systems to configure the best possible version of their own craft they can find.

#### Ship Skills

In _**Dark Star**_, ships have five skills (Engines, Hull, Sensors, Systems, and Weapons) that represent how each ship is customized and prepped for missions. Since all the pilots in the setting are assumed to be amazingly skilled individuals, it's the build of the ship that determines what a pilot can do in the cockpit. Instead of rolling Operate or Survival, all rolls pilots make while in space are made using the following ship skills:

**Engines:** A ship's engine can be used to overcome distances and obstacles, as well as create advantages for keeping up with fleeing prey or setting up a strafing run. It cannot be used to attack, but it can be used to dodge enemy fire with a defense roll.

**Hull:** Typically used to defend against enemy attacks, the hull of a ship can also be used as a battering ram to make attacks. At the same time, it can also be counted on to overcome obstacles or create advantages when appropriate, such as flying through hanger doors to escape a ship.

**Sensors:** Want to see outside your ship? This skill can be used to overcome and create advantages to learn more about your environment. It can also be used for electromagnetic attacks, but most ships are shielded enough for that to be a rare attack.

**Systems:** Everything internal to the ship, including attempts to fix problems and keep things running, rely on internal systems. Keeping things up and running by overcoming obstacles and creating advantages is the primary use of this skill.

**Weapons:** One of the most versatile skills, the weapons on a ship can overcome obstacles, create advantages through suppressive fire, and attack other ships. It cannot be used to defend.

These five skills cover nearly everything pilots want to do in space, including dogfights and runs on capital ships. For new ships, pilots assign the following skill ratings to the skills above: +3, +2, +1, +1, +0. [[Capital]] ships and transports are built the same way: a peak skill, one skill at one less than the peak skill, two skills at two less than the peak skill, and one skill at three less than the peak skill. The largest Imperial capital ship---a Sunwrecker-class battleship---has ship skills at +9, +8, +7, +7, and +6.

### Stress and Consequences

Fighters don't have stress boxes, but they can take two consequences: a mild (2) and a moderate (4). Larger ships may have stress boxes and larger consequences to represent how much more fire they can take before folding. Typically, capital ships have the more traditional mild (2), moderate (4), and major (6) consequences along with at least 2-3 stress boxes.

When pilots take stress while piloting their fighter, they can opt to take the stress themselves or allow their ship to take consequences (`Flying Blind], `Busted Engines], `Clipped Wings]). Pilots need to make (or find someone to make) Repair rolls with a Great (+4) difficulty to get their ship back to full capacity, removing the consequence and getting back into the air at full strength.

## Opening Scene: Trouble at 10 Forward

After a few days on flight detail, Blue Squadron finally has some time off from running missions on behalf of the outpost scientists. Most of the time, this results in drinking and carousing, accompanied by the occasional fight with one of the other squadrons (Green Squadron or Red Squadron). The scene opens with the player characters at 10 Forward, the officer's club aboard _The Victorious_, enjoying a round of drinks to celebrate their hard-won time off from flying.

As they get the night underway, however, Lt. Dakchi---the best pilot in Green Squadron---decides to start trouble with one of the characters, preferably one of Dakchi's rival pilots. Dakchi's drunk, and he insists that they owe him money for a bet they made on who could get closer to the Dark Star on their last run. How will they deal with a drunk and belligerent pilot without getting thrown in the brig themselves? And will they let Dakchi claim to be the better pilot in front of the rest of the crew?

### Possible Costs for Failure

**Minor Costs:** 1 stress, drawing attention to the argument, banned from 10 Forward

**Major Costs:** 2 stress, Angry, arrested by Imperial military police### Opening Aspects and Opposition

### Skill Modes?

_**Dark Star**_ uses Skill modes for NPCs instead of individual skills. When NPCs take action in accordance with that general activity, they get the skill rating of the mode. If no skill mode is appropriate, the NPC rolls on a +0. These NPCs can also gang up and assist each other---if Dakchi's three or four friends decide to help him in a bar fight, they would each add +1 to his roll.### Middle Scene: Attack on The Victorious

However the characters decide to deal with Dakchi, their time in 10 Forward is cut short by a sudden and dramatic tilt in the floor. Something has knocked _The Victorious_ off-balance, and the screech of the ship's hull indicates that the anti-grav systems are having trouble coping with the [[shift]]s in the gravity well. As the crew gets to its feet, a call goes out over the ship's internal communications for Blue Squadron to scramble fighters.

The characters have to go from 10 Forward all the way to the rear of the ship to access the Blue Squadron hanger bay. The trip usually takes just a few minutes, but the ship is listing at a 40-50 degree angle! If the characters make any attempts to access the nav systems, they discover that the Dark Star let out a massive burst of gravitational energy that threw _The Victorious_ into a spin. They need to get to their ships to do a sweep of the Dark Star!### Possible Costs for Failure

**Minor Costs:** Angry, Exhausted, lost in the ship

**Major Costs:** Injured, minor consequence, blocked passages### Opening Aspects and Skill Challenges

Opening Aspects:` Listing Ship], `Damaged Hull],
`Confused Soldiers ]`and]` Crew]

As the characters make their way to the Blue squadron hanger, they may
encounter a number of obstacles and opportunities. In general, selecting
roughly two challenges per character gives everyone time to shine. Here
are a few skill tests characters may need to make to get to their ships
and get the hanger doors open:

**[[Athletics]]:** _The Victorious_ is listing and drifting, conditions that
might call for pilots to have to climb "up" hallways to get to their
destination. Difficulty: Fair (+2) to Great (+4)

**Doctrine:** Listing ships tend to be confusing, and the characters may
get lost (minor cost) as the result of a failure on another roll.
Remembering the floor plan of a particular section of _The Victorious_
will get them back on track. Difficulty: Fair (+2)

**Operate:** The sudden stress on the ship's hull from the gravitational
wave has collapsed sections of _The Victorious_. Some doors that should
be open have been locked by the automatic systems and need to be opened
manually. Difficulty: Great (+4)

**[[Provoke]]:** Lost and confused soldiers may get in the way of the
pilots' attempts to get to their ships. A simple order to get back to
work will remove such an obstacle. Difficulty: Good (+3)

**Repair:** In addition to the damaged doors, many other systems have
malfunctioned, leading to a lack of oxygen in some parts of the ship.
Activating backup life support systems requires rerouting emergency
power. Difficulty: Good (+3)

## Final Scene: Protecting The Victorious

Once the characters get their ships out into space, they finally get a
sense of the situation (especially if they use their Sensor ship skill
to create an advantage). _The Victorious_ is under attack by an alien
transport ship, one with enough firepower to potentially crack the hull
of the Imperial capital ship. Worse yet, _The Victorious_ was disabled
by the gravitational wave and doesn't have any defense against the
smaller alien craft. Can they neutralize the alien craft before it
destroys _The Victorious_, leaving them stranded on the edge of the
galaxy?### Possible Costs for Failure

**Minor Costs:** 1 stress, exposed to fire from alien ship, confused
sensor readings

**Major Costs:** 2 stress, ship skill disabled, separated from Blue

The opening scene of Dark Star isn't the end of the adventure. The
players may have disabled or destroyed the alien ship, but the mystery
of the Dark Star is still unsolved. And don't forget the impending
issues! Here are a few plot hooks and adventure seeds to keep the story
going, varying the tone and pace of scenes after the initial attack on
_The Victorious_:

### Entering the Dark Star

Right before the alien ship was disabled, it launched a probe back into
the Dark Star. Sensor readings indicate that a neutrino shield unlike
anything currently developed by Imperial scientists protected the probe
from whatever Dark Star energies usually destroy such launches. If
similar technology could be replicated---either using materials
recovered during the battle or through a boarding mission to the alien
ship---the pilots of _The Victorious_ could lead a mission into the Dark
Star itself to finally answer Dr. Lee's questions and gather the data
they need to determine if more alien ships are going to emerge. [[Will]] the
pilots risk their lives to head into the Dark Star? What will they find
if they make the journey?

### White Hawk Contact

After dealing with the alien ship, the pilots get a contact report from
_The Victorious_ indicating that a small White Hawk fleet has jumped
into the system. Armed with orders to investigate, the pilots find that
the rebel ships are badly damaged and offering to surrender. Worse yet,
the damage done to the White Hawk fleet seems to be from weapons with
radiation signatures similar to the alien ship that emerged from the
Dark Star. What attacked the rebels and where did it come from? And can
the rebels be trusted to surrender or is this all a trap?

### Dr. Lee Seeks Allies

Now that the Dark Star has proven capable of connecting to an alien
dimension, Dr. Lee is looking for support in her demands to expand the
program. Specifically, she wants the pilots who fought the ship to help
her convince Imperial Command to send more resources...and she's willing
to offer her own support in a transfer back to the Core if the pilots go
along with the plan. In the next few days, an Imperial Admiral is
scheduled to visit _The Victorious_ for an inspection. Captain Reznik
won't be thrilled with the pilots speaking up; will anyone dare to
support Lee in an attempt to gain the freedom to return to the civilized
part of the galaxy?## Sample Characters

## Lt. Vin "Candy" Candiotti -- Blue 10

Lt. Candiotti isn't fit for duty. He's a mess. His ship is a mess.
Everything about him says that he should be pulled off duty and sent to
flight school, just so that he can learn some manners and dress himself
without spilling food everywhere. But he's one of the best damn pilots
in the galaxy, and his Squadron and Flight Leaders put up with him
because he's an excellent pilot with a nose for solutions to tough
problems. Underestimate him---and his food stained clothing---at your
own peril.

**Linked Navs.** When creating an advantage using your sensors for the
first time in a scene, add an extra free invoke to the aspect you create
for each additional pilot flying in your squadron.

**I Know a Guy.** +2 to [[Contacts]] rolls made to find people on board your
primary capital ship.

## Captain Payton "Coyote" Sazla -- Blue 11

Unlike most of the other pilots on _The Victorious_, Sazla didn't break
any rules or get herself into trouble with the Empire. Instead, she's
been sent to the edge of the galaxy because she's too mentally unstable
to be trusted with a squadron in the War. Ever since the Battle of
Molantuni, Sazla's taken bigger and bigger risks with her ship and her
squad, and the Empire's decided she needs some time running missions for
Outpost 7232B-a to cool off before returning to active duty.

**Death Wish.** You can roll [[Will]] instead of [[Athletics]] when you come
straight at an enemy with more firepower than you (i.e., you only have a
knife and your opponent has a gun or you are dramatically outnumbered).

**Kamikaze.** When attempting to ram another fighter or transport, spend
a [[fate point]] to force your opponent to reroll. The second roll cannot be
rerolled, even if the opponent spends a [[fate point]] to invoke an aspect.

## Lt. Krans "Hound" Petro -- Blue 12

Convicted of repeated murders on the Core worlds, Petro was sentenced to
death. Lucky for him, the Empire tests all criminals for useful
aptitudes---his skills as a pilot saved his life as the Empire commuted
his sentence. Now he wears a cybernetic collar that records his every
action, forcing him into service and earning him the callsign "Hound."
He loves flying. And egging on Candy to do all the things his collar
keeps him from doing. He also longs for Dr. Tanya Lee, but she rarely
gives him a second look or responds to his attempts to impress her with
his flying.

### Aspects
