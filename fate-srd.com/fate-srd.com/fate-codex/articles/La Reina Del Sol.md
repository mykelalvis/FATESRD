## THE EASTERN SEABOARD ALLIANCE

In 2264, the Eastern Seaboard Alliance (ESA) implemented legislation to
dramatically expand subsidized housing across previously condemned areas
of what was once known as New Jersey. Following the nuclear detonations
that accompanied the Sheffield Rebellion in 2229, large sections of the
area had been condemned as unlivable; the ESA's "starfield legislation"
dedicated billions of public dollars toward new megadevelopments that
would make better use of the irradiated countryside through public
housing.

### The Starfield

Friends and foes alike call the area "the starfield" because of the
bill's unfortunate acronym, a result of a late-night committee meeting:
Special Trust Agreement for Reclamation and Recovery Yards (STARRY). Not
to be deterred, the ESA Senator who shepherded the agreement through
committee doubled down on the imagery: the various blocks of
development---each miles wide and hundreds of stories tall---were named
after star systems (Sol, Centauri, Sirius, etc.).

The starfield has stood for nearly thirty years, but little has been
done to maintain or improve it after the initial legislation. The
unemployment rate across the ESA spiked last year to 63%; millions of
people live crammed into small areas rife with crime, drugs, and other
unsavory shadow economies. Machines do the work that employed millions
of people just a century ago, but that doesn't mean that the surpluses
of the automated economy are distributed evenly. Or at all, really.

### La Reina del Sol

With the emergence of those underground economies came powerful cartels,
arising throughout the starfield to traffic in guns, drugs, and other
illicit goods. In the first few years, the police did their best to
regulate such organizations, but the amount of money moving through
these dense areas was overwhelming: drug organizations bribed all the
police they needed to do their business virtually without interruption.

And as these organizations flourished, so did the fortunes of _narcas_
like Erika Ramos, La Reina del Sol (The Queen of Sol). Rising to power
on a wave of murders, power grabs, and innovative financing schemes, La
Reina is the "unofficial" mayor of Sol, the person you need in your
corner if you want to get ahead in a criminal enterprise. Cold, cruel,
and paranoid, La Reina is a perfect shark, never sleeping in the same
place twice, living on the edges of society, and always looking for
prey.

### Power and Pride

La Reina is a relatively young, light-skinned Latina---her black hair
usually worn shoulder length---with a nasty scar encircling her left
eye. She's fond of combat boots and dresses, but more for the ease of
use in both cases than any particular fashion sense. She spends a great
deal of time absorbing video streams from across Sol, looking for
patterns, following up on hunches. She's brutally effective at
discovering trouble before it strikes and she's rarely seen without her
two-headed dog, Ciccio.

Rumors abound now that La Reina was married to the former head _narco_
in Sol, a man named Ricardo Reyes. Patriarchal assumptions aside, many
had seen them together in the weeks before his death and assumed that
Reyes had taken an interest in the young woman who had climbed the ranks
of his organization so quickly. Anyone in the know says without
hesitation that Ramos and Reyes weren't an item...but they shut up quick
when conversation turns to her role in his death.

The truth is that Reina has only been married once before...to the man
who gave her the scars around her left eye. His fate was bloody and
swift, and La Reina refuses to talk about exactly what led to the
scar...or where his body ended up. She's given orders that no one speak
his name in her block; he's merely _el hombre muerto_ if someone needs
to make reference to him.## ERIKA "LA REINA DEL SOL"  RAMOS

## FRONT: HUNTING MOLYNEUX

La Reina does more than just control Sol. She works to keep her hold
secure and her rule unchallenged, eliminating threats before they can
blossom and expanding her power base within the nearby Centauri and
Sirius blocks of the starfield. No one has yet ruled multiple blocks in
the starfield, but La Reina figures that a queen can hold any space on
the chessboard she wants, and she's willing to risk it all to claim more
territory.

No one lives forever, _cabrón_. Not even a queen.### What is a Front?

A front paces the plots and schemes of villains or the terrible doom
awaiting the PCs if they don't engage with the problems emerging within
the setting. Think of a front like a train, hurtling down the tracks
toward a brick wall, ready to smash through everything unless the PCs
get in the way.

Each front features a countdown clock, a prescriptive and descriptive
measure of both what will happen if the front is left unchecked and how
much more time is left before the front is fully realized. If the front
is ignored, you tick down each section of the clock, until it reaches
the doom that awaits the PCs (prescriptive); if something achieves a
portion of the front's future plans early, move the clock directly to
that section (descriptive).

As the clock gets closer to midnight, the action becomes more elevated
and the stakes become more dire. If the PCs can stop the front early,
they may be able to avoid the worst of the consequences; waiting to
intervene until the clock is nearly exhausted means that the front will
have permanent effects on the setting even if the PCs manage to stop it.### Description

La Reina has put a plan in motion to assassinate a rival drug kingpin
operating out of Centauri: Mr. Elad "Monet" Molyneux. An amateur painter
and educated gentleman, Molyneux is a charming contrast to Ramos, a
well-protected member of the elite whose holdings happen to be slums
throughout the starfield. Nevertheless, his control of the police makes
an assassination attempt both difficult and expensive; La Reina has gone
to great lengths to ensure he meets an unpleasant fate while attracting
little attention to her own activities.

### Cast

Erika "La Reina del Sol" Ramos, the cruel queen of Sol's criminal
underbelly; Mr. Elad "Monet" Molyneux, artist and drug kingpin of
Centauri; Roberta Perez, _sicaria_ for La Reina hunting Molyneux;
Detective Claudia Byrne, an unwitting accomplice to La Reina's plot.

**12:00--3:00:** Perez captures one of Molyneux's money couriers working
in Sol, disrupting a number of bribes Molyneux needed to keep the police
away from his distribution centers around the Sol/Centauri border.

**3:00--6:00:** Det. Byrne, acting on an anonymous tip, requests a
warrant for one of Molyneux's distribution centers. To her surprise, the
warrant is approved.

**6:00--9:00:** Det. Byrne raids the distribution facility, interrupting
the supply of drugs flowing throughout both Centauri and Sol and sending
Molyneux's holdings into disarray.

**9:00--10:00:** Molyneux moves to lock down his control over his
territory and travels into Sol to reprimand his lieutenant who oversees
their border operations. Shortly after crossing the border, Perez and
her gang attack his convoy.

**10:00--11:00:** Molyneux, disoriented and alone, tries to find cover
at a local safehouse in Sol. Neighborhood kids see him enter and quickly
spread the word to his enemies.

**11:00--12:00:** Perez finds and kills Molyneux. His lieutenants in
Centauri split: some swear fealty to La Reina while others go to war to
avenge Molyneux's death. Chaos ensues.

### Special Rules

In addition to a countdown clock, fronts also contain a number of
special rules revisions that focus play on the important themes of the
setting:

**Too Many:** La Reina's forces in Sol are too numerous to be directly
defeated. It is impossible to start a conflict with her forces inside
her home block. Any fights are treated as contests ([[Fate Core]] System,
page

150) to escape or evade her nearly infinite supply of goons.

**Overdue Bills:** Anyone looking for information on Molyneux's
activities within Centauri may roll [[Resources]] instead of [[Contacts]] by
bribing the disgruntled police.### Fronts in play

When events in the front tick down toward the 12:00 doom, make sure the
PCs are aware of the events. Depending on their position in the fiction,
they might hear about something through the grapevine or directly
witness one of the NPCs making a move. Give them chances to interrupt
and get mixed up in the plot!## ENGAGING LA REINA DEL SOL

La Reina focuses on asymmetrical power: she always shows up with a crew,
even when it's probably not needed, and she'd rather have discussions in
her territory than make herself vulnerable. She's not worried about law
enforcement, but she also doesn't take chances that don't have a
significant upside. That said, she's got a number of buttons that are
fairly easy to push; she'll go to great lengths to pursue someone if she
feels that they undermined her authority in Sol.

Building blocks offer interesting characters and locations, but it's up
to the GM to integrate them into a game of Fate. Sometimes the
integration is obvious---an urban crime lord is an obvious addition to
any modern or near-future setting---but here are a few ideas to help you
generate interesting PCs to engage this building block if you aren't
already running a game in an appropriate setting.

### Antagonists

The PCs might be directly opposed to La Reina, characters that will work
to not only stop her from assassinating Molyneux but also to bring her
to justice. For some, this may mean working through a chain of evidence
that would hold up in court; others may be happy merely killing her
before she can do any more harm to the people of Sol. Of course, La
Reina wasn't born yesterday; she's well prepared for attempts to disrupt
her hold on Sol, even if they're coming from official personnel.

Examples: law enforcement, restrained vigilantes, private security,
secret agents

### Rivals

Rather than direct antagonists, the PCs might be rivals to La Reina,
characters who would benefit from her fall but who aren't willing to
work directly against her...yet. For example, Ramos has a number of
rival drug lords all over the starfield in addition to Molyneux. Players
looking to play rivals of La Reina ought to prepare themselves for a
different and difficult setting in which they may not emerge victorious!

Examples: other drug lords, vengeful vigilantes, local street toughs

### Lackeys

The PCs might also play characters who work directly for La Reina's
gang, ranging from enforcers and street soldiers to freelancers who are
sent on special missions to give La Reina plausible deniability.
Remember to give these folks strong reasons to care about the front if
you make use of it in your game; most of La Reina's employees won't be
upset if a tragedy befalls Mr. Molyneux unexpectedly.

Examples: street soldiers, hired mercenaries, cartel operatives

### Mixed Groups

It's also possible to construct a group of PCs who have competing
interests around La Reina's activities, such as several vigilantes who
are mixed up with law enforcement, rival cartels, and folks inside the
criminal organization. Be careful with such mixed character types; make
sure that there are plenty of character ties between each character and
that all the players are prepared for the inevitable increase in player
vs. player conflicts.

## ADAPTING LA REINA DEL SOL

While La Reina is a perfect fit for the nearly post-apocalyptic urban
blight of the starfield, she's also an excellent villain and antagonist
across settings. Here are some ideas for adapting La Reina to other
environments. Note the additional stunt that would make her character a
more natural fit for the alternate setting.

### Space Station

The starfield is easy to translate to a space station or small moon for
games with a far-future setting. It may be necessary to replace a few
skills---[[Crafts]] and [[Lore]] might be more specific skills like Engineering
or Science---but overall La Reina can be queen of literal stars as
easily as she controls Sol. In fact, it might make it more interesting
for her to control an entire station, since the PCs ought to be
surrounded at all times by her lackeys and potential allies.

#### ALTERNATE STUNT

**Freshly Transported:** Add +2 to creating an advantage with [[Resources]]
when you pursue opportunities to make use of  "lost"  or  "surplus"
trade goods.

### Western

La Reina's casual violence would fit well with a western setting, but
the lack of a complex social structure would require her to have more
personal strength: swap both [[Shoot]] and [[Fight]] up in her skill tree to
replace [[Resources]] and [[Contacts]], respectively. That's not to say she
can't have a gang---she might be an outlaw more than the head of a
criminal organization---but she won't have dozens of killers at her
disposal.

#### ALTERNATE STUNT

**At Dawn:** When you challenge someone to a duel, treat any success to
[[create advantage]] with [[Provoke]] as a success with style. If the opponent
wins the roll, they cannot add any free invokes but still may create an
aspect on the scene.

### Medieval Fantasy

La Reina might also be well-represented as a literal queen or military
leader in a low-fantasy setting. Like the western, you'll need to find a
way to convey the scope of an organization in a setting that doesn't
have an infinite number of goons, but La Reina can plot from the shadows
with far fewer legal restraints. She can be a member of a court, for
example, plotting just off screen to secure the throne for herself.

#### ALTERNATE STUNT

**Distractions:** Roll with [[Resources]] instead of [[Burglary]] when you
wastefully display a resource to [[create advantage]] for yourself.
