Fate Codex

# About The Fate Codex

by Mark Diaz Truman

When I first launched The Fate Codex back in 2013, I had a feeling we would be able to do some neat things with writers that I wanted to work with more often. Since we feature short pieces, it made sense that we'd be a great place for folks to write for again and again, a mostly-monthly magazine that offered writers a place to try new things and explore what Fate can do.

For this issue, I'm proud to say that we've got three authors returning for (at least) their second article with us: Richard Bellingham, André La Roche, and (of course) our new Managing Editor, Tara Zuber. Each of these folks is a Fate rock star, and I'm so thrilled to feature their newest work here in Vol. 3, Issue 2. From Richard's new ideas about bestowing awesomeness on objects, people, and places to Tara's deep dive into the mechanics of stress to André's delightfully sinful Quick Start (filled with demon motorcycle gangs), I think this issue features folks that are at the top of their respective games.

And yet...our new writers aren't quite ready to get overshadowed by these old hands. Alexandre Malette has put together an awesome systems piece that brings elements of [[Fate Core]] and [[FAE|Fate Accelerated]] together into one unified approach (pun intended!) that rivals some of the best work I've seen in Fate design. I'm especially excited about Alexandre's attention to detail, the way he thinks about exactly how many skill points players need or how to keep any given mechanical choice from being universally dominant. It's good work, and I'm excited to share it with you all in this issue.

So...buckle up! We're two issues into the year with much, much more to come. Tara, as Managing Editor, has done a great job filling our pipeline with awesome pieces for the next few months, and our podcasting efforts are just now getting off the ground. We're so excited to make The Fate Codex a bigger, better, brighter, busier, blastastic (not a word? what?) publication in 2016, and we hope you enjoy the show.
