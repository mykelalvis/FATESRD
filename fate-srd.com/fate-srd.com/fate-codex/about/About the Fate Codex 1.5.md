Fate Codex

# About The Fate Codex

_by Mark Diaz Truman_

Three months. Three issues. This is beginning to become a bit of a pattern!

Welcome to the fifth issue of The Fate Codex! I'm proud to present in these pages an amazing set of articles dedicated to making your Fate game a more exciting, inclusive, and compelling place. We've got intriguing thoughts from folks like Shoshana Kessock and Marissa Kelly on how to make Fate work at your table and a set of creative travel skills from Tara Zuber that are a great start to any setting you might be building that finds the characters on the road. And I haven't even talked about Kira Magrann's amazing queer noir setting of lesbian pulp!

One of the best parts of serving as Editor in Chief of The Fate Codex is that I get to see all of these pieces as they grow and change throughout the editing process. Ideas are tried and set aside, new thoughts are clarified and expanded, and each piece blossoms into something uniquely exciting. I love what we're publishing, but I enjoy the process of publishing as much as I enjoy the final product.

As we look to the final months of 2014, I know that we're wrapping up the last few issues of Volume 1. We've had a good run so far, and I'm thrilled to know that all of you have enjoyed these issues, that the ideas we've gathered up and refined are making your Fate games even better. I'm excited to start thinking about Volume 2, and I can't wait to see what comes forward when we start taking open submissions for The Fate Codex later this year. Thank you for your support!
