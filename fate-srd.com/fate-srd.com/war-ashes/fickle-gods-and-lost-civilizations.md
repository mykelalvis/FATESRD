# Fickle Gods and Lost Civilizations

## Fickle Gods' Curses and Blessings: Design Notes

This is an expansion of **"The Subtle Art"**, found in the Fate System
Toolkit. It adds a little mechanical crunch by creating temporary stunts
and aspects that can be invoked for effect. It is suitable for a fantasy
setting where the gods are powerful, capricious beings who bicker among
themselves and don't always show wisdom or restraint, such as the Greek
pantheon.

If used with skills, you may want to define or re-define a skill
associated with propitiating the gods and slinging their blessings and
curses. Such a skill might be called Commune, Propitiate, or Petition.
Alternately, you could use [[Will]] as the skill for magic.

If used with approaches, you only need to pick the appropriate one as
usual at the time of praying.

## Divine Interest

The gods are fickle and dangerous---their benevolent attention is nearly
as dangerous for devotees as their anger.

Think of people as pets, and the gods as their lackadaisical owners.
There's not that much communication going on, and every once in a while
the owners remember to put some food down, but all too frequently they
completely misunderstand whether you wanted the litterbox cleaned, more
water, or walkies. But pee on the carpet or ignore them for too long,
and oh boy! It might be off to the pound with you. Or worse.

To represent this, the GM uses a method that looks similar to the
character sheet's consequence boxes to track _Divine Interest_. It
functions like a set of consequences for the entire group of heroes,
recording how much attention they have attracted among the gods. Note
that Divine Interest consequences cannot be used in conflicts between
two player characters.

### Attracting Divine Interest

Examples of things that would cause Divine Interest (i.e., add to the
next lowest open Divine consequence) include:

- Rolling [++++] or [----] on the dice. Even if a [[fate point]] is
  used to re-roll, the point will be incurred although the result of
  the action will be changed.
- Obtaining a Miraculous (+9) or better result---a.k.a. succeeding
  catastrophically.
- Obtaining an Abysmal (-4) or worse result---a.k.a. heroic calamity.
- Performing a magic ritual.
- Certain costs associated with magical stunts(see "**Magic"**).
- Doing something extravagant, extraordinary, eccentric, or otherwise
  distinguishing you from those around you, in place of taking a
  personal consequence.

> _When Rhea rolls a [----] on her roll to decipher an old grimoire
> containing useful nautical charts, her player invokes an aspect and
> spends one [[fate point]] to re-roll. She rolls a +1 instead so the
> failure is averted, but the GM still marks a Divine consequence for
> the group._
>
> _Pyrrhus has bitten off more than he can chew. When a group of rowdy
> pirates takes him up on his challenge to fight them all at once, one
> of them lands a terrible blow that would result in a severe
> consequence. Rather than take it himself, Pyrrhus' player opts to
> have the group gain a Divine consequence instead. Pyrrhus prays to
> Zeus for strength. And the god answers with lightning bolts!_

The GM tracks four Divine Interest consequences---two mild consequences,
one moderate, and one severe---for the group of adventurers, each of
which represents on-going attention from the gods; you can attract the
attention of different gods this way, or get the same one more and more
excited about your adventure. They're not watching you constantly, but
occasionally they remember your existence and intervene in your favor or
against it, depending on the relationship.

### Sample Divine Interest Consequences

**Mild Consequences**:

- *[Clamor of Armies] *(Ares, Mars, Tyr)
- *[Hair Turning Leaf-Green] *(Artemis, Diana)
- *[Persistent Localized Thunderstorm] *(Zeus, Jupiter,
  Tlaloc)
- *[River Running Backwards] *(Tethys, Chalchiuhtlicue)
- *[Chiming Bells Whenever Someone Is Lying] *(Hera, Thoth,
  Bragi)
- *[Singing Rocks] *(Ourea, Tepeyollotl)

**Moderate Consequences**:

- *[Maelstrom] *(Poseidon)
- *[Rain of Blood] *(Ares, Mars)
- *[Swarms of Locusts] *(Demeter, Ceres, Isis, Xipe-Totec)
- *[Turn Wine Into Water] *(Dionysus, Bacchus)
- *[Visions of Death] *(Hel, Hades, Pluto, Mictecacihuatl)

**Severe Consequences**:

- *[Attracts Monster Hordes] *(Loki, Tlaltecuhtli)
- *[Belch Lightning] *(Thor, Zeus, Jupiter)
- *[Fireblast] *(Apollo, Xiuhtecuhtli)
- *[Shipwreck] *(Poseidon, Neptune)
- *[Withering Crops] *(Demeter, Ceres, Sif, Centeotl)

**Recovery: **Mild Divine Interest consequences are easily cleared; a
minor milestone will allow one mild consequence to be cleared. But a
moderate one will last at least two sessions and until a significant
milestone, at which point it can be reduced to mild.

Severe Divine Interest consequences stick with the heroes and change
them: the gods' attention is now firmly on you. They will keep
continuously watching you and they will use you as their pawn, champion,
martyr, or prize in their schemes and struggles. Sure, they will forget
about you for long stretches of time, but the gods' divine gaze is now
firmly fixed. A severe Divine Interest consequence will last at least
through one significant milestone and until the next major milestone.

> *A while ago, the heroes took the severe consequence **[Displeased
> Hera] **by failing to serve her diligently enough. When the
> GM declares a major milestone, the group decides to change the
> consequence to **[Atoning to Hera] *_and decide to make some
> amends, perhaps go on a quest to appease her. The consequence is
> reduced to moderate._

**Being Taken out by Divine Interest: **When you've already filled all
four of the Divine Interest consequence slots for the group without a
chance to clear them, and get one more such consequence, you are taken
out just like with regular stress. At the end of the session, you will
have a Divine milestone. Clear all Divine Interest consequences and
discuss a new group aspect, which can be invoked and compelled as usual.
This should be an aspect the entire group, players and GM, agrees will
make sense and be fun in the campaign.

_**Pawn of ___**_: When the god needs a cut-up for some reason, you
end up being at hand. You find yourself in some cockamamie situation you
are spectacularly not suited to because the god needs a marker of some
sort.

_**Marked by ___**_: When there is nothing more interesting going on,
the god checks on you, causing alarm and repercussions. You may develop
a reputation for being bad luck.

_**Embroiled in Divine Plots**_: After one god showed interest, others
also paid attention. You're like the ball in this game, and the winner
will probably spike you before forgetting about you and going out to
celebrate.

If you gain mostly favorable attention by doing something the gods think
is neat, they will appear to you with a message---probably accidentally
setting the place on fire or causing other collateral damage in the
process. They may be trying to impress their benevolence upon you, and
generally trying to help you, but are in fact being as useful as you are
when you help ants build their little ant hill.

If you manage to anger, disappoint, or vex the gods, they will send you
the occasional lightning bolt strike, put dangerous and ridiculous
obstacles in your path, cause storms, floods, or earthquakes to follow
you, or turn you into a talking ox. The only thing that will provide any
respite is the gods' gaze turning to someone else.

Being taken out by Divine Interest consequences can be the signal for a
major milestone and possibly even a re-scaling of the campaign. The
heroes are now embroiled in world-spanning shenanigans. In that case,
combine the effects of both the major and Divine milestones.

**The Many Gods:**It is perfectly possible to attract the Divine
Interest of more than one deity, which may in turn result in many
different group aspects.

> _After many adventures, the heroes managed to attract the [**Wrath of
> Ares**], the [**Benevolence of Athena**], and
> probably the attention of a few other deities as well_

## Description

The gods are powerful beings who can grant a worshipper's petition
through blessings and curses. Easily bored, they often turn an eye to
their most unpredictable creations, the mortal beings who populate this
world, wage war, and constantly invent clever new ways of getting in
trouble. The gods like to intervene in mortals' affairs to guide,
reward or punish, but the force they use is not necessarily commensurate
with their supplicants' requests.

Mortals can take the risk of begging the gods for these blessings and
curses, knowing that the thunderbolt meant for an enemy may land close
enough to singe the petitioner as well. Praying too earnestly can be
dangerous; then again, ignoring the gods, neglecting to make the proper
obeisances, can attract divine anger and retribution

Magic is in many ways more trickery and taking credit for fortuitous
success than actual arcane workings; after all, no one wants the gods to
get too close. Priests mostly_pretend_to perform rituals without
actually attracting attention from the gods, whose appearance is
dangerous even to their devotees.

So why do magic-users risk it? One: it works. Sort of. Sometimes. In
battle it can make all the difference. Two: the gods get very, very
touchy when you neglect them, and they react badly. Then it's not
ambiguous, two-edged, or risky at all: it's all bad.

Priests' objectives, then, are to minimize the amount of actual god
involvement in mortals' affairs while maximizing the satisfaction of
their flocks and patrons. They try to do just enough actual magic and no
more, covering the rest with a mix of sooth-saying, show-boating,
quackery, and blind luck.

> **Magic: The 30-Second Version**

> 2. Choose a ritual and perform the required chanting, dancing, and so
> forth.

> 3. Make an appropriate approach roll to overcome against the target
> of the ritual.

## Use an Appropriate Aspect

Not everyone can perform magic rituals; you need an aspect that grants
permission such as [_**Oracle of Apollo**_], [_**Freyja-Blessed
Seidhr**_], [_**High Priest of Jupiter**_], or
[_**Self-Trained Hedge Priest of Demeter**_].

## Choose a Ritual

Some *rituals *have similar working in all versions of Agaptan magic,
although their trappings will be vastly different from one faction to
the next and even one school to the next. In addition, each has its own
exclusive rituals. Notes for rituals can be literal pieces of writing,
but they can also be recorded as complex series of knots in a string,
glyphs carved in stone, etc. It's difficult for a priest to decipher
rituals from another school, and painstakingly difficult to even guess
at another faction's rituals.

Rituals' primary effect is to allow a blessing or curse to be placed on
a _target_---the person, place, or thing it's being cast on. Sometimes
a ritual will also have a _subject_---the person, place, group, or thing
which will be the focus of the ritual's effect on the target.

_A Rage ritual to make Julius angry at Lilia would be cast on Julius (the target) and focused on Lilia (the subject)._

## Casting A Ritual

In order to cast a ritual, the priest must use one or more actions to
overcome the target difficulty. With a success, the ritual creates a
temporary stunt (see the list below). Rituals that produce good luck or
beneficial effects for the target can either give a +2 bonus in narrow
circumstances for one scene, *or *give a one-time special effect before
dissipating. Rituals that produce bad luck or negative effects for the
target produce a one-time special effect lasting up to one scene, then
dissipate.

Assuming a single target---a person, or a thing perhaps as large as a
hut---enough time to chant or mumble the sacred words, and the
appropriate ritual trappings, the roll is made against a difficulty of
Average (+1). So long as the character succeeds, then the target gains
the blessing or curse---see below for details---for the scene or until
it is no longer dramatically appropriate, whichever comes first. Further
modifications follow:

Target                                                                                                             Difficulty

---

Base difficulty _(self, object, or other person within contact range)_                                             Average (+1)
Object, area, or person is in sight but not touch range                                                            Add +1
Target person not present, but a powerful symbolic tie to them is present*(their blood, a treasured possession)*   Add +2
Target person not present, but is known and named, or is a known location                                          Add +3
Target is as big as a ship or small building                                                                       Add +1
Target is as big as a large building or arena                                                                      Add +2
Target is as big as a small town                                                                                   Add +3
Unforeseen difficulties _(performing the ritual in a rush, while underwater, at spear point)_                      Add +1 to +3*(GM's discretion)*
Praying to a god you have angered _(having unfavorable Divine Interest consequences or aspects)_                   Add +2
Unwilling target                                                                                                   Add +1

Larger targets require much more time, the efforts of several priests,
and luck.

Some rituals have a subject, such as a ritual that makes your lord mad
at his daughter. The absence of that subject similarly impacts the
difficulty: +0 if present, +3 if you only have a name, as above. The one
qualifier is that if the subject can be made to accept some token of the
ritual---a potion, a trinket---then they are effectively "present."
Such tokens must be used within a short time, typically three days.

Success with style on a ritual generates a boost as normal.

No target can be the focus of more than one ritual at a time. The newest
ritual replaces the existing one.

Some blessings and curses have their own additional modifiers.

High difficulties can be beaten by having multiple priests working
together and by treating the ritual as a challenge (see**"Challenges"**.) Create as many steps as you need, assigning
static difficulties; the sum of these difficulties must be equal to or
greater than the ritual difficulty you calculated.

> *Coronos, priest of Ares, is performing a ritual to bless his brother
> Vettias with good luck; however Vettias is halfway across Achaea,
> doesn't **want *_Coronos's help (or any attention from Ares for that
> matter), and Coronos has recently displeased Ares by fleeing from
> battle. He has the Divine consequence [**Coward in Ares'
> Eyes**]. The difficulty to cast the spell therefore is +1
> (starting), +1 (unwilling target), +3 (Coronos has no link to
> Vettias), +2 (Ares is displeased), for a total of Epic (+7). Vettias
> won't go into combat for another day, and Coronos has two assistant
> priests nearby to help him out. They cast the ritual together and
> break the difficult ritual into three smaller challenges._
>
> *Using Skills: First, one of them prays to Ares to forgive Coronos, a
> Fair (+2) difficulty using the skill Propitiate, then another focuses
> the ritual on Vettias at a Fair (+2) difficulty, and finally Coronos
> **forces *_his no-good stubborn brother to accept the blessing at a
> Good (+3) difficulty._
>
> *Using Approaches: First, one of them Flashily prays to Ares to
> forgive Coronos, a Fair (+2) difficulty, then another Carefully
> focuses the ritual on Vettias at a Fair (+2) difficulty, and finally
> Coronos Forcefully **forces *_his no-good stubborn brother to accept
> the blessing at a Good (+3) difficulty._

Casting a ritual incurs a Divine Interest consequence. The priest can
eliminate this cost---in other words, avoid Divine Interest---by
performing the ritual as a challenge instead of a single overcome
action: one roll to avoid the god's attention, one roll to cast the
ritual, and one roll to make it look coincidental.

> _Coronos is at it again! He's trying to perform another difficult
> ritual but this time he's all alone, and terrified of incurring more
> of Ares' wrath by praying to a different god, Zeus. The ritual's
> difficulty is Superb (+5) but Coronos is going to try it anyway. First
> he avoids the gods' attention with a roll using [[Stealth]] (in a
> skill-based game) or Sneaky (in an approach-based game). Since the
> gods are often forgetful and currently distracted by a war, the GM
> sets the difficulty at only Average (+1). Then Coronos casts the
> ritual itself, hoping nobody around him notices, using Propitiate
> (skill) or Quick (approach) at the Superb (+5) difficulty. Finally, he
> pretends he had nothing to do with the storms gathering overhead. Ares
> may have not been paying attention, but his fellow Athenians sure are
> wary of him, so the GM sets that at a Good (+3) difficulty for Deceit
> (skill) or Sneaky (approach). If he succeeds at all three, the ritual
> is cast without anyone being the wiser and he doesn't gain a Divine
> consequence. Phew!_

### Why Risk It?

Why would your priest character bother to cast a ritual and thus get a
Divine Interest consequence for the group to worry about?

Because this allows you to create effects that would not be possible
otherwise, like a [**Sudden Gust of Wind**] created by using (Bad) Luck on enemy archers, harmlessly dispersing a volley of arrows.

Because if you are very Careful and don't mind anonymity, you can cast
without attracting attention to yourself.

Because attracting a god's attention can get you a boon!

Because sometimes it's do or die.

Because it's fun! Divine Interest is part of the flavor of the world of
Agaptus, and if your characters are going to be heroes---even reluctant
ones---then sooner or later they will attract Divine Interest. Embrace
the risk!

**You Can Always Cheat**
Some do it all the time. Your character tells onlookers that you are
casting a ritual, you chant some nonsense, and donothing. But if you
really want them to believe you, consider using Deceit (skill) or Flashy (approach) to overcome an obstacle, and put on a good show. If you are
getting paid to cast the ritual, you pocket the money and go to the
nearest tavern to have a drink. Naturally, you can only use this trick
so many times before your deception catches up with you. Perhaps your
customers become angry, or perhaps the gods are starting to notice
anyway

## General Rituals

Magic rituals typically influence luck in small ways or push and pull on
the target's emotions.

**Annoyance: **The target rubs people the wrong way. If the ritual has a
subject, then this particular subject is more easily annoyed by the
target of the ritual. Creates temporary stunts like:

**Grating Voice:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene, the target's
voice is so irritating that those they speak to can hardly remember the
actual words.

**Looks Like This Jerk I Used to Know:** As a one-time effect lasting
one scene, the target creates a bad impression on someone they just met.

**Sounds Fishy to Me:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene, the
target is refused the assistance they asked for.

**Charisma: **While related to love, this turns it on its head by
improving the target's general presence and demeanor. It's sometimes a
subject of ridicule---specifically, ridiculing those who would need such
a ritual---but it sees a lot of quiet use. Creates temporary stunts
like:

**Great Hair:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to Flashily create an
advantage when good looks would matter.

**Isn't That the Famous Guy?:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene,
the target is treated like a Very Important Person by those they meet.

**Charming Wit:** For one scene, that target gets +2 to overcome social
opposition with [[Rapport]] when they have a chance to impart a witty
comment to their audience.

**Clarity: **Popular among those who fancy themselves cutting-edge
scholars, for some this ritual is their cup of coffee, sharpening their
thoughts and senses and allowing them to study all night. It's also a
popular "counter-ritual," used to remove curses. Creates temporary
stunts like:

**Ready for a Long Night of Study!:** For one scene, the target gets +2
to Carefully create advantages based on detail and research.

**Sharp As a Tack:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to Forcefully
overcome obstacles that would dull their wits, like fatigue or too much
kogg.

**Can't Fool Me:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to defend against
social or verbal attacks based on [[Deceive]].

**Clumsiness: **You know those days where you dropped a glass, spilled
your kogg in your lap, and ripped your shirt on a latch? This makes for
that kind of day. Creates temporary stunts like:

**All Thumbs:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene, anyone picking
up the target object acts unusually clumsy and awkward.

**I Never Even Saw It:** As a one-time effect, the target collides while
in motion (walking, running, riding, etc.) with someone or something
they had not noticed.

**It Could Happen to Anyone:** As a one-time effect, the target
missteps, or drops an object they were holding.

**Confusion: **People tend to misunderstand the target if it's a
person, or get easily lost if it's a place. Creates temporary stunts
like:

**It's That Accent:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene, the
target has difficulty getting understood, and everyone misinterprets
their speech.

**Was It Left or Right?:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene,
people reaching the target location become disoriented and tend to
retrace their steps or take the wrong path.

**What Was the Middle Part Again?:** As a one-time effect lasting one
scene, the target forgets or jumbles the instructions they received and
commits a rookie mistake.

**Health: **The magical equivalent of your mom's chicken soup. Creates
temporary stunts like:

**Feeling Better Now:** As a one-time effect, the target can immediately
clear a mild health-related consequence (injury or illness). For a +2
difficulty, the target can immediately downgrade a moderate consequence
to mild; for a +4 difficulty, the target can downgrade one severe
consequence to moderate. Only one target can be affected per scene, and
consequences can only be improved once per session this way.

**Top Form:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene, the target gets an
extra mild consequence slot. If the extra mild consequence scene is not
used in the scene, it vanishes at the end of the scene. If the target
takes two mild consequences in the scene, they both last until the end
of the next scene.

**Strong as an Ox:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to [[Physique]] when
overcoming obstacles that require feats of strength.

**Love:**One of the better-known but also most contentious rituals,
especially when used with a subject. Without a subject, it simply makes
the target more friendly towards the world, but with a subject, it
inclines the target toward the subject. A lot of people view this as
skeezy at best. It's a touchy topic, and a number of priests get around
this by deliberately casting dud rituals. Creates temporary stunts like:

**Be Still, My Heart!:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene, the
target is distracted with interest for the subject, eager to make a good
impression on them.

**Hey, Check This Out!:** For one scene, the subject gets +2 to Flashily
create advantages by befriending, charming, or flattering the target.

**What A Wonderful Day!:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene, the
target is as cheerful and well-disposed as circumstances allow. If in an
adverse situation (pursued by hungry wolves, chained at the oars of a
war galley, etc.), the target keeps up their spirits and see the silver
lining to every cloud.

**Luck: **This is the most common ritual in circulation, and it can take
the form of good or bad luck. Creates temporary stunts like:

**This Is My Day:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to Quickly
overcoming dangerous obstacles.

**I Should Have Stayed in Bed:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene,
the target is the victim of a mishap such as mistaken identity, lost
purse, stolen cart, mud splash, etc.

**Wow, Really?:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene, the target
benefits from a happy coincidence such as finding a long-lost item,
being favorably noticed by their superior, or getting the best seat in
the theater.

**Obscurity: **The target is easily overlooked---by the subject, if
appropriate. Whether this is a blessing or a curse depends a lot on your
perspective. Creates temporary stunts like:

**Not Worth Paying Attention To:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to
Sneakily create advantages based on remaining in the background.

**This Has Been There Forever:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene,
the target item is overlooked by passers-by.

**Ho-Hum:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to [[Deceive]] when defending
against attempts to discover their true identity.

**Prosperity: **Another popular blessing, financial things fall the
target's way. It's rare that this turns into a large windfall, but it
can show up as a loan extension or free drinks. Creates temporary stunts
like:

**Next One's On Me:** As a one-time effect, someone buys the target a
meal or a drink.

**It Must Have Been in the Lining of My Pocket:** As a one-time effect,
the target finds a small, useful object in a pocket, usually a coin.

**Ride That Streak:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to Cleverly
overcome while gambling. Naturally, anyone caught casting this sort of
ritual will be run out of town with extreme prejudice�

**Rage: **Small things annoy the target more than usual, as if they'd
woken up on the wrong side of the bed. If the ritual has a subject, then
the target of the ritual is more easily enraged by that subject. Creates
temporary stunts like:

**I Swear, If They Ask One More Time:** As a one-time effect lasting one
scene, the target snaps at the next person who talks to them or
approaches them. This does not mean the target will place themselves in
danger---a merchant won't attack an armed warrior, but she may be
short-tempered and unhelpful.

**Raw Nerves:** For one scene, you or an ally get +2 to [[Provoke]] when
[[create advantage]] by goading the target into anger.

**I'm Not Gonna Take It Anymore:** As a one-time effect lasting one
scene, the target gets angry whenever a particular topic comes up.

**Safety: **Keeps the target or area safer than it would be. Creates
temporary stunts like:

**Not Worth Attacking:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to [[Deceive]]
when defending against search attempts.

**Nothing Going On Here:** As a one-time effect lasting one scene, the
target location attracts no attention unless and until someone does
something noteworthy, like screaming for help, having a fight, etc.

**Snug As a Bug in a Rug:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to
Sneakily [[create advantage]] by hiding.

**Augury: **A peek into the near-future. Creates temporary stunts like:

**I Saw This Coming:** As a one-time effect, the target can choose to
completely avoid the effects of one attack instead of rolling defense.

**I Had a Hunch:** As a one-time effect, the target can claim to have
made any preparation for the scene such as bringing an object, speaking
to a contact, prepared a meal, etc., if they could reasonably have done
so by knowing in advance this situation was coming.

**Two Steps Ahead of You:** For one scene, the target gets +2 to Quickly
overcome obstacles and challenges that are also based on speed.

> _A band of soldiers are pounding on the door of the abandoned farm
> house where our heroes are spending the night. Gudrun the Witch asks
> her daughter Siggi to hide in the root cellar while she goes out to
> check the source of ominous noises. Before she leaves, she casts a
> Safety ritual, invoking Frigg's protection._
>
> _The target (Siggi) is present (+0), normal size (+0), there is no
> specific subject because Gudrun doesn't know who the threat is, so
> the difficulty would normally be Average (+1). However, time is of the
> essence so Gudrun wants to shorten the ritual; the GM says this will
> increase the difficulty to Fair (+2) and require the use of the Quick
> approach._
>
> *Gudrun's player agrees and rolls for Gudrun's ritual, to Quickly
> create an advantage; the dice roll[*0+00]_and Gudrun's Quick
> approach is +2, for a total of +3 (Good), which beats the difficulty.
> Gudrun's ritual gives Siggi the stunt _**Nothing Going On Here**_._
>
> _The GM notes a mild Divine Interest consequence for casting a ritual;
> the roll and result did not generate additional points._

## Battle Rituals

A particular type of ritual, called_battle rituals_, are used to affect
the priest's entire side of the conflict **before the actual conflict
begins**. They work differently from general ritual: instead of creating
temporary stunts, the priest uses the battle ritual to create magical
situation aspects with free invocations. Battle rituals' effects
typically last until the end of the conflict scene.

Battle rituals have a fixed difficulty of Fair (+2) to cast.

Optional: If you are using the Roar Phase rules, battle rituals are used
_only_ during the Roar phase and call on the power of its transcendent
state. After the Roar phase, priests can still cast general rituals that
provide temporary stunts for individual targets, but the time for
roaring is passed.

**Combat Fury:__The priest intercedes to the unit's god, asking to lend
special strength and savagery in combat. Very similar to the Rage ritual
below, but fine-tuned for the battlefield. Creates advantages
like [_Divine Savagery_], [_Divine Wrath_],
or [_Divine Strength_]. By spending a [[fate point]] or using a
free invocation and invoking for effect, the targets of the ritual can
also make one attack lethal (see_"Lethal Attacks"_).

**Troop Movement**:A priest may ask the unit's god for assistance in
moving them across the battlefield. Hopefully the god will move them in
the intended direction. Creates advantages like [_Pushed by a Divine
Wind_], [_A Burst of Speed_], or [_Right Where They
Should Be_]. By spending a [[fate point]] or using a free
invocation and invoking for effect, the targets can also move an extra
zone for free.

**O God Avoid Us, Seek Out Those We [[Fight]]**: This battle ritual is
similar to the (Bad) Luck ritual above, but placing a temporary mild
Divine Interest consequence on the enemy for the scene. Weapons miss,
the sun glints off the enemy's armor, etc. Creates advantages like
[_Zeus Disapproves_], [_How Could This Have Missed?_],
or [_Nope, Not Today_]. By spending a [[fate point]] or using a
free invocation and invoking for effect, force the next consequence that
would result from an attack to be taken as a Divine Interest
consequence.

**Our God [[Will]] Smite Them All!**: War priests use this ritual to whip
troops into a frenzy for the scene. Creates advantages like [_Smite,
SMITE!_], [_Our Blows Land True_], or [_All At
Once!_]. By spending a [[fate point]] or using a free invocation
and invoking for effect, the targets can also take one additional mild
consequence before being taken out (useable only once per conflict per
target). After the conflict, the extra mild consequence remains until
cleared normally.

**We Are Legion!**:Battle priests use this ritual to bolster the focus
and discipline of units for the scene, helping them through the often
complex battlefield maneuvers required by commanders. Creates advantages
like [_Soldiers, Advance!_], [_Form Up the Ranks!_,]
or [_To Me, Brothers!_]. By spending a [[fate point]] or using a
free invocation and invoking for effect, the targets can also ignore
adverse terrain aspects for all zones they move through this turn. In
other words, these aspects cannot be invoked against them to oppose
movement.

### Using skills:

Chaka the shaman, in preparation for the upcoming battle, casts the
ritual "Troop Movement" on his scout unit to help them make it through
the dense forest and flank the enemy. Chaka's player rolls [+0+-]
plus his [[Will]] (+2) versus the difficulty of Fair (+2), for a total of +1 (Average) and a success. The scouts can now use the aspect [_**Stalking
on Leopards' Feet**_] with one free invocation. The group also
gets one Divine Interest consequence for the use of magic.

### Using approaches and the Roar phase:

> _During the Roar phase, Sven casts the ritual_ _"Our God [[Will]] Smite
> Them All!" on the crew of the _Skyhammer _to get them ready to fight
> in the upcoming boarding action against the_ Fiero_. The difficulty is
> Fair (+2)._
>
> _Sven yells to the sky and sea for aid and the group agrees that
> sounds like the Flashy (+3) approach. Sven's player rolls an
> amazing[_++++]_, for a total of +5 (Superb) and succeeds with
> style._
>
> *Sven is now roaring with the aspect **[Smite, SMITE!] *_and
> is limited to using the Forceful, Flashy, and Clever approaches to
> maintain the ritual during the conflict._
>
> *The crew of the *Skyhammer *rejoice and can use the **[Smite,
> SMITE!] *_aspect normally or invoke it for effect to gain an
> extra mild consequence for the fight._
>
> _The gods take notice of course. The group gets one Divine Interest
> consequence for Sven casting the ritual and a second for the
> natural[_++++]_that was rolled. It could be Tyr excited by the
> battle, but the GM thinks it will be more fun for Loki to take
> notice!_

## Wondrous Artifacts of the Ancients

Our Ancient ruins are to fantasy worlds what abandoned Roman roads,
bridges, temples, and aqueducts would have been to inhabitants of the
British Isles circa 900 A.D. They also borrow flavors from ancient
marvels of architecture from around the world like the ones left by the
Mayans, Inca, Zhou Chinese, Ancient Egyptians, Khmer, etc., and from
fiction like legendary Atlantis, Mu, Shambhala, and so forth.

They are forgotten, made nearly invisible by their ubiquity; everywhere
in Sentia one sees ruins, and entire villages and cities are built among
these. In addition, the incipient ice age has driven the land's
inhabitants to live underground more and more often; what better place
than the catacombs, vaults, and half-buried palaces of the Ancients,
with their unmatched masonry?

> **Is it Magic?** These marvels are not magic, except in the sense of
> Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law ("Any sufficiently advanced technology
> is indistinguishable from magic."); they come from advanced but

> and dyes - printing - paints and lacquers - physics and chemistry -
> masonry, stone-cutting, and mosaic - glass-blowing, ceramics, glazes -
> Ship-building - And probably many more; mysterious, poorly understood
> knowledge. No magic need be involved.

## Mechanics

Ancient wonders work primarily as plot drivers, influencing the story:
MacGuffins, _deus ex machina_, objects of quests, and the chance for
sweeping changes in the balance of power if some of those secrets are
unlocked.

Most of the time, this can be represented entirely by using aspects. A
few practical devices may provide a stunt, and if durability or damage
absorption is an issue, the device may get a stress track. In order to
decide how an Ancient wonder works, we need to answer a few questions:

1. **How complex is the item's function?** The more complex, the more
   mechanical details may be needed; for example, an astrolabe is going
   to need more detailed definition than a sword.

2. **How general is the players' understanding of the item, and how
   much do they agree?** If it's likely that everyone at the table
   will clearly understand and agree, you need little in the way of
   mechanical details, but if it's unfamiliar to at least some of the
   players, you may need more mechanical detail. For example,
   ephemerids and maps are about equally complex items, but the map is
   much better understood by most people, so it may not need more than
   an aspect, while the ephemerids might deserve a stunt.

3. **How versatile will the item be in the story?** If the item is
   going to be used to do many different things, it potentially
   requires more definition. For example, a manuscript on medicinal
   properties of plants may be used more often than one on creating
   rare colors of ceramic glaze.

4. **How prominently will the item feature in the story?** If an item
   is to be prominent and frequently used---not merely seen, like the
   ruins of a temple, but used for some story purpose with mechanical
   effects---then the GM may want to define it more precisely, for
   example by creating a stress track and perhaps giving the item a
   minor consequence to absorb damage.

Here are some guidelines for GMs:

**Usability: **Most of the Ancient technology will get very little
actual use in play.

**Scale: **Most of it is represented by large-scale buildings and ruins:
public buildings, bridges, aqueducts, sewers, public baths, roads,
lighthouses, ports, monuments, and temples.

**Mystery: **So much knowledge is missing that the primary purpose of
any artifact discovered is probably unclear; the GM should probably give
it a few mystery stats, such as unassigned aspects and/or stunts, even a
stress track that gets marked off at unexpected times.

**Function: **Most of the time, the primary purpose should be something
practical or logical which you can imagine in the real world, not
"boots of flying" and "belts of ogre strength." But the features
which are first discovered may in fact be secondary or by-products, just
like you can have a whistle on a key chain or a clock readout and a
camera on your telephone.

The best way to work through this is to work through a few examples.
First, let's look at the most common Ancient wonder, the ruins of some
large building or public works. They can generally be handled by
aspects, some of which may be obvious and others that the players may
have to work to discover.

**Example 1: An Ancient lighthouse.**

If the site is still in fairly good shape, it may be easy to discover
the high concept aspect Ancient Lighthouse, or the aspect can even be
known already without the need to [[create advantage]] to discover it.

However, the GM may add one to three less obvious aspects if the site is
important to the adventure. For example, it might have [_Hidden Crypt
Deep Below_] if you want a scene or even a whole adventure
about poking in the depths beneath the lighthouse, or [_Line Up the Two
Fires to Navigate Through the Reefs_] if the lighthouse is a
navigation clue to help the heroes reach their destination, or [_Secret
of the Undying Flame_] if this is really about the liquid fuel
which the Ancients had devised to keep the beacon lit.

Note that these additional aspects could also be flaws, but they should
be intrinsic to the Ancient location or device. In Example 1,
[*Dangerous Vermin *]or *[Dripping Flammable
Liquid] *could exist, but they would be more scene aspects than
item aspects. The next time your heroes visit the site, you might
emphasize something different. See **"Creating Adventures"** for more
on scene aspects.

Don't stack too many aspects, though; use the minimum you need to get
the story moving. First, too many aspects may leave the scene a confused
mess, and dilute the importance of any single aspect. Second, you can
always come back some other time, in some other story, and use different
aspects for the same location to emphasize what is of interest in the
current adventure. Finally, if you don't define more than you strictly
need to, you are left free to pounce on any great ideas the players may
come up with and use that instead in your next scenario!

Let's look at a second example, something that is still a building but
where the original function is versatile and harder to guess at.

**Example 2: The ruins of an Ancient apothecary shop.**

When you open the scene, you may have this listed as a [_Small
Half-Collapsed Building_] and let the players do a bit of
snooping---perhaps treated as a challenge---before they can discover the
aspect [_Half-Collapsed Apothecary Shop_]. Note that we've now
replaced or redefined what was a scene aspect. Now, every time they
return, the PCs will find the [_Half-Collapsed Apothecary
Shop_], at least until they manage to demolish it further

The players may want to get some practical use out of a location like
this, so if this is meant to be a chance for them to reduce some
consequences they have taken previously, you could assign it the stunt:

**Ancient Apothecary Shop**: Because this is an Ancient apothecary shop,
heroes get +2 to a recovery check when fighting off the effects of an
illness (recovering from a consequence.)

You may want to limit such a location's use if you don't want to see
it become the convenience store open all night which they keep visiting
to fix problems. One way to do this is to assign narrower circumstances
for use, such as a specific illness or type of illness. Another is to
assign a number of uses after which, the supplies or equipment are
exhausted. _Once_ is a perfectly valid number!

Here is an example of public works where the original function might
seem very difficult to understand at first. Its function is specialized
but potentially very important to the setting.

**Example 3: The ruins of a canal and lock system.**

Depending on how damaged it is, it may not contain water when the heroes
first see it; or it might be iced over if it's located in the north or
the adventure takes place at some time other than the short summer
months. At each end is a body of water, at different elevations.

The high concept to discover would be Canal and Lock System. If the PCs
succeed in restoring it to a working state and the climate conditions
allow it, a stunt would become available:

**Ancient Canal and Lock System**: Because this is an Ancient lock
system, once per session (or twice a day, or other reasonable time
increment that the GM wants) it allows a ship to move between Water Body
A and Water Body B.

However, the importance of such a site is not just about moving a ship
where you couldn't before; it's about acquiring that knowledge and
using it in other locations.

What about something portable, specialized, and arcane?

**Example 4: Ancient compass.**

This device might be very damaged; if of the wet type, it would probably
have dried up and requires refilling with water or clear alcohol and
resealing; if of the dry type, the needle might need re-mounting and the
moving parts cleaning and waxing.

Understanding, refurbishing, and using the device can be handled as a
challenge, perhaps over a long period. Even after the compass is in
working order again, its usefulness for navigation might not be obvious.

The high concept could be simply called [_Compass_], or [_A
Device That Always Points in the Same Direction_].
Understanding its usefulness would make a stunt available:

Ancient Compass:Because this device always points north, heroes get +2
to Carefully overcome obstacles when orienting their course.

Now let's look at something portable, versatile, and fairly complex but
relatively easy to figure out.

**Example 5: Ancient multi-tool.**

_Did you know the Romans had invented multi-tools? It's true!_

If the tool is in good shape, it becomes fairly easy to guess at the
purpose of a few of the attachments; if it's very damaged and partly
disintegrated due to rust, it may be much more difficult.

The primary aspect will be something like [_Folding
Multi-Tool_]. Once a hero figures out how to make the various
parts move, some potential stunts may come to mind; but now we're
looking at many different stunts that apply in many different
circumstances.

Instead of trying to list them, it may make more sense to just grant a
number of free invocations of the high concept aspect, say one or two
per session. It can of course be invoked as normal at the cost of a fate
point. For flavor, it might be renamed to something like [_I Have the
Tool for That!_].

Because it might be a coveted item that sees a lot of use, the GM might
also want to give it a stress track, say one or two boxes, and even a
minor consequence to represent some of the tools getting warped or
broken.
