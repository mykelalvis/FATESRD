War of Ashes

# Adventure Creation, Expanded

This section expands on the advice provided in **Chapter 9** of _Fate
Core_ using a method for writing scenarios called _Fractal Adventures_,
which relies heavily on [[the Bronze Rule]] of Fate. It was created by
author Ryan M. Danks, and a more detailed discussion of the method can
be found on his website, starting with [[adventure-fractal|[[Fate Core]] Adventure Fractal 2.0]].

A *scenario *or *adventure *is one short story arc, the sort of thing
you might see wrapped up in one or two sessions of an adventure
television show, even if it's a smaller part of a bigger story. Usually
you can wrap up a scenario in one to three game sessions, assuming you
play for three or four hours at a time. But what is a scenario, and how
do you build one?

> **Creating A Scenario: The 30-Second Version**

1. Pick a Goal and High Concept Aspect
2. Find Problems
3. Pick a Trouble Aspect
4. Scene List: Ask Story Questions
5. Pick Adventure Aspects and Approaches
6. Establish the Opposition
7. Set the First Scene Once you get the hang of it, writing an
   adventure should take about twenty minutes, assuming you already
   know what the story will be about.

## Goal and High Concept Aspect

First, you need a goal; this is the problem(s) the story will center
around. What is it the PCs want? Create an aspect to represent the goal;
you can call it the adventure's high concept.

Once you know the goal, decide whether or not the PCs will obtain their
goal---"maybe" is a sufficient answer here, relying on the PCs to
determine success or failure on their own. It isn't always necessary
that they succeed; failure leads to more adventures.

## Find Problems

Scenarios are centered around a problem which the heroes will try to
solve, encountering twists and turns as they move towards resolution.

**A scenario needs two things: **An adversary with a goal and a reason
the PCs can't ignore it.

**Adversary with a goal: **You've probably figured this out already.
The campaign's main opposition, or one of his allies, is probably your
adversary.

**Something the PCs can't ignore: **Now you have to give the PCs a
reason to care. Make sure the adversary's goal is up in the PCs'
faces, where they need to do something about it or bad things will
happen to them, or to people or things they value.

And that's how your "problem" is born.

Here's the best tool to make sure the PCs can't ignore the hook: go
fishing from their character sheets for problems they_want_to interact
with, and from the campaign aspects for problems which they
are *bribed *to tackle.

### Problems and Character Aspects

Look at the characters' aspects and see if anything can make a nice
juicy core problem for an adventure. When you're trying to get a
problem from a character aspect, try fitting it into this sentence:

You have **[aspect]**, which implies that **[fact about that
character or the world]**. Because of that, it would be probably be a
big problem if **[describe a situation]**.

The second blank is what makes this a little harder than an event
compel---you have to think about all the different potential
implications of an aspect (and this may be a list of things, by the
way). Here are some questions to help with that.

Who might have a problem with the character because of this aspect?

Does the aspect point to a potential threat to that character?

Does the aspect describe a connection or relationship that could cause
trouble for the character?

Does the aspect speak to a backstory element that could come back to
haunt the character?

Does the aspect describe something or someone important to the character
that you can threaten?

As long as whatever you put in the third blank makes a nice story
problem, you're good to go.

> _Ulf Long-Teeth has [**The Good Ship Blaggard**], which
> implies that he inherited his ship from somewhere. Because of that, it
> would be a problem for him if he was challenged for command._
>
> _Iva the Stubborn is [**Searching for Her Banished Lover**],
> which implies that her lover has enemies at home. Because of this, it
> would be a problem for her if she needed help from one of his enemies
> to find her lover's whereabouts._
>
> _Rustica Bibulus is a [**Connoisseur of Atronian Folklore**],
> which implies that such folklore may contain elements of truth that
> have been overlooked by scholars. Because of this, it would be a
> problem for her if the pursuit of an obscure legend brought her face
> to snout with a mythical monster._

### Problems and Game Aspects

Problems you get from a game's current and impending issues will be a
little wider in scope than character-driven problems, affecting all your
PCs and possibly a significant number of NPCs as well. The game aspects
include the ones you chose in your campaign creation process, any
scenario or adventure aspects, and perhaps some lingering aspects from a
previous adventure.

Attach one or two aspects to the adventure you're designing; you can
use the aspects suggested with every story seed in this book such as the
ones attached to location descriptions, or come up with ones that are
tailored for your group. As an incentive for players to get involved,
you can allow one free invoke per adventure, or even one per game
session for multi-session scenarios; alternately, you can use it as a
compel on the PCs, offering them [[fate point]]s for going along with the
problem.

**When you're trying to get a problem from a game aspect, try fitting
it into this sentence:**

Because **[aspect]** is an issue, it implies **[fact about the
character or the world]**. Therefore, **[describe a situation]**
would probably create a big problem for the heroes.

**Ask yourself:**

What threats does the issue present to the PCs?

Who are the driving forces behind the issue, and what messed up thing
might they be willing to do to advance their agenda?

Who else cares about dealing with the issue, and how might their
"solution" be bad for the PCs?

What's a good next step for resolving the issue, and what makes
accomplishing that step hard?

> *Because the **[Lost Island of Konar] *_is an issue, it
> implies that the location is both hard to find and dangerous.
> Therefore, having to retrieve a map from Kuld-infested territory would
> probably create a big problem for the heroes._
>
> *Because **[Secrets of the Ice] *_is an issue, it implies
> that the information is valuable, coveted, and protected. Therefore,
> reaching an elderly scholar and protecting him before rivals capture
> him would probably create a big problem for the heroes._
>
> *Because **[The Seal of Prolyus] *_is an issue, it implies
> that the organization has gathered temporal power. Therefore, an
> alliance of the organization with a powerful Merchant House would
> probably create a big problem for the heroes._

### Problems and Aspect Pairs

You can also create problems from the relationship between two aspects
instead of relying on just one. That lets you keep things personal, but
broaden the scope of your problem to impact multiple characters, or
thread a particular PC's story into the story of the game.

There are two main forms of aspect pairing: connecting two character
aspects, and connecting a character aspect to an issue. They look like
this:

**Two Character Aspects:**

Because **[character]** has **[aspect]** and **[another
character]** has **[aspect]**, it implies that **[fact about the
characters or the world]**. Therefore, **[describe a situation]**
would probably be a big problem for the heroes.

**Ask yourself:**

Do the two aspects put those characters at odds or suggest a point of
tension between them?

Is there a particular kind of problem or trouble that both would be
likely to get into because of the aspects?

Does one character have a relationship or a connection that could become
problematic for the other?

Do the aspects point to backstory elements that can intersect in the
present?

Is there a way for one PC's fortune to become another's misfortune,
because of the aspects?

> *Because Ulf has **[Family Trumps Everything. Almost.] *_and
> Iva has [**Single Mother With A Fawn**], it implies that Ulf
> is loyal to his family but also understands family loyalty in others.
> Therefore, siblings of Ulf hired to kidnap Iva's fawn to blackmail
> her would probably be a big problem for heroes._
>
> *Because Rustica has **[Overachieving Elvorix Scholar] *_and
> Ulf has [**Out to Make A Name for Himself!**], it implies
> that they are both ambitious and competitive. Therefore, finding the
> clues to a treasure trove of Ancient artifacts, which Rustica wants to
> remain secret to all but the Academy, and which Ulf wants to describe
> in heroic tales of his mighty deeds, would probably be a big problem
> for the heroes._
>
> *Because Iva has **[Sponsored by the Stone-Seekers] *_and
> Rustica has [**Owes Valius Nummus a Favor**], it implies that
> their patrons have their own agendas. Therefore, Iva and Rustica both
> promising to bring back the same Ancient artifact, the Mask of
> Kuldarus, to their respective sponsors would probably be a big problem
> for the heroes._

### Character Aspect and Game Aspect

Because you have **[aspect]** and [aspect] is an issue, it implies
that [fact about the character or the world]. Therefore, [describe a
situation] would probably be a big problem for you.

**Ask yourself:**

Does the issue suggest a threat to any of the PC's relationships?

Is the next step to dealing with the issue something that impacts a
particular character personally because of their aspects?

Does someone connected to the issue have a particular reason to target
the PC because of an aspect?

> *Because Rustica has **[The Collected Notes of Peony the
> Elder] **and **[The Seal of Prolyus] *_is an issue,
> it implies that the manuscript might be worth much to the secret
> organization. Therefore, the Seal of Prolyus trying to steal the notes
> from Rustica would probably be a big problem for her._
>
> _Because Ulf has [**The Good Ship Blagaard**]_ _and **[Lost
> Island of Konar] **is an issue, it implies that Ulf will face
> some challenges when he sails his ship in search of the lost island.
> Therefore, the_Blagaard_becoming trapped in a Bermuda Triangle-like
> area of sea would probably be a big problem for him._
>
> *Because Iva has **[I Can See Further Than You Ever
> Have] **and **[Secrets of the Ice] *_is an issue, it
> implies that Iva will be interested in the long-term effects of the
> Great Catastrophe on the ice. Therefore, choosing between pursuing the
> mission the heroes undertook or dropping it to pursue new information
> about the cause of the new ice age would probably be a big problem for
> her._

You can also browse the story seeds in this book and see if any of them
generate ideas for connections with your character aspects, issues, and
campaign aspects.

## Trouble Aspect

How will you make it inevitable that the PCs will act toward that goal?
To keep tension as you move from scene to scene, create a trouble
aspect. This should represent the danger or death that's overhanging in
the adventure; again, if there's no chance of physical, psychological,
or professional death at all times, there is no tension, which means a
boring game. The trouble is what happens if the PCs ignore the
adventure, and also what will step in from time to time and remind them
why what they are doing matters.

_Kim picks a few ideas from her list and lays the bare bones out in
detail as a Fractal Adventure:_

**The Mask of Betrayal: Aspects**

**Goal: **[_**The Mask of Kuldarus**_]

_The PCs must locate and retrieve this item to prevent it from falling
in the wrong hands._

**Trouble Overhanging: **[_**The Seal of Prolyus Is On the
Trail!**_]

_The wrong hands, or at least some wrong hands_

### Reinforcing the Themes

If you want the adventure's aspects to strongly color the action, make
them known to the players and allow the players to invoke these
adventure aspects like any other.

## Scene List: Ask Story Questions

Once you have your goal, work backwards to create the scene
list---scenes are where players get to play; without them, you have no
game. This is where you need to create a list of story questions.

How do you flesh out the situation which you created with the problems?
You start by asking lots of story questions as yes/no questions, in the
general format of:

"Can/[[Will]] **[character]** accomplish **[goal]**?"

You don't have to follow that phrasing exactly, and you can embellish
on the basic question format in a number of ways. The first question you
will ask for a given adventure, but probably the last you will answer,
is:

"Can the heroes resolve the adventure problem?"

All the other story questions will be the dotted line, the stepping
stones leading to this one. Each can explore a specific facet of the
problem, including who, what, where, when, why, and how.

> **The Mask of Betrayal: Problem and Story Questions** *Because Iva is **[Sponsored by the Stone-Seekers] *_and Rustica [**Owes Valius Nummus a Favor**], it implies that their patrons have their own agendas. Therefore, Iva and Rustica both agreeing to find the same Ancient artifact, the Mask of Kuldarus, and bring it back to their respective sponsors would probably be a big problem for them._  *Some questions immediately pop to mind because they are implied in the choice of aspects used to create the problem: [[Will]] Iva get the mask for the Stone-Seekers? or [[Will]] Rustica repay Valius Nummus? These are the questions we will be answering by the **end *_of the scenario._ _In order to get there, we have to answer some other questions. We're reasonably confident that both Iva and Rustica will be interested in finding the mask, but [[Will]] Rustica agree to bring the mask back to Valius Nummus? If the answer is "no" right at the start, then Valius Nummus might decide to force the issue through some other means---persuasion, blackmail, threats---or he might try to locate the artifact himself, or hire a rival team._ _Will Iva and Rustica share with the group the requests their respective sponsors have made? Perhaps one or both will choose to keep it a secret. And if they share the information, Can the PCs come to an agreement on what to do with the mask? This might take the whole adventure to resolve, or they might immediately decide that one faction has better title to the prize._ _Do the heroes know where to find the mask? If not, then that's probably a chunk of the adventure right there, finding out the artifact's whereabouts. This is a good place in the adventure to use Rustica's scholarly abilities, Iva's arcane connections, and Ulf's mundane ones._ _Can they get there? Sometimes getting there is half the fun. Or all the fun. The players have shown interest for lost islands and sea adventures, and this will hook Ulf into the scenario, so Kim decides that there must be a sea voyage to a dangerous location protected by teeth-like reef formations and treacherous breakers._ _Is there a reason why neither the Stone-Seekers nor Valius Nummus have already obtained the artifact? There must be great difficulties in recovering the mask, otherwise it wouldn't be an adventure. Difficulty of access, dangers, guardians, even magical protection shield the mysterious artifact._ _Is there a reason to search for the mask now? If the group prefers to limit the amount of investigation in a given scenario, then perhaps a manuscript has just been discovered that talks about the location of the mask; that way, the problem is reduced to obtaining the manuscript and deciphering it. If on the other hand the players love investigation but tend to dissolve into analysis paralysis, perhaps the clock is driven by the fact that a rival team---say, Laetitia Bibulus and the Seal of Prolyus---is already on its way to retrieve the mask and put it to ill use._ _Do the PCs know what the mask's properties are? There is ample room for secrets and surprises. What does the thing do? Under what circumstances?_ _Is Valius Nummus friend or traitor? To what ends does he wish to acquire the mask?_

**Pro Tip: Multiple Solutions**

When you're asking your story questions that will lead to scene ideas,ry to think of several different ways of completing a segment and several different paths to get the end questions, the ones that are wrapped up in the problem. One way to do this is to ask,_How would a player or a group complete this if_:

- They want to investigate their way through?
- They want to fight their way through?
- They want to negotiate their way through?
- They want to sneak their way through?

Jot down your answers for later use. As a rule of thumb, if you can't
think of at least two or three ways to get the job done, then your
scenes or adventure may be too narrow.

### Assembling the List

What steps will the players need to take to achieve their goal? To bring a killer to justice, they might first have to discover his whereabouts, which requires discovering who he is, which may require questioning witnesses and following clues, which requires investigating the crime scene, which requires being alerted to the crime.

Read that backwards and you have your scene list: hear about the crime, investigate the scene, talk to witnesses and follow clues, discover the killer's identity, discover his whereabouts, take him down.

While reading this list, you might decide to increase the tension somewhere in the middle. Maybe a witness turns up dead, or a fight ensues between a masked killer and the PCs as they arrive just before a witness is murdered. This is logical, as the killer would want to throw off the investigation.

You can mark some scenes as core and others as optional; you can also jot down notes when some scenes need to be played in a specific order. Witness interviews and clue investigation can probably be played out in any order, for example, but the last few scenes may need to happen sequentially. If you know you will be limited by time when you run your game, you can concentrate on the core scenes and watch the clock to decide whether to lead into one of the optional scenes, such as the murder of a witness.

_Kim uses her story questions to create a list of possible scenes:_

**The Mask of Betrayal: Scenes**

**The Theft: **_Valius Nummus' shop has been burglarized and the Teran manuscript stolen. Attributed to Tera Bibulus, the manuscript may contain clues to the location of the Mask of Kuldarus. Valius asks Rustica for help retrieving both manuscript and mask._

**Recovering the Manuscript: **_Discovering the identity of the thieves and getting the manuscript back. Since the thieves used violence, there is probably going to be a physical confrontation._

**The Stone-Seekers' Interest: **_The Stone-Seekers approach Iva and
offer help in finding the Mask of Kuldarus, but ask her to bring it back
to them, not Valius Nummus._

**Researching the Mask: **_The PCs---most likely Rustica---will probably
want to do a little background research into the history, location, and
nature of the mask._

**Race for the Prize: **_The PCs learn that another group is already on
its way to recover the mask from its resting place. Set sail!_

**Nautical Adventures: **_Good time to encounter the rough climate of
the World of Agaptus, pirates, sea monsters, and a fight against the
rival team. This can become several scenes, depending on how much fun
the players are having._

**The Forbidden Temple: **_The PCs reach the location of the mask, brave
its defenses, and face the competition for possession of the artifact._

**Who Gets the Mask?: **_Valius Nummus wants it, as do the Stone-Seekers
and the Seal of Prolyus, and perhaps a secret cult dedicated to
protecting or using the mask. Some of these factions may be covert
allies._

**Important Note**:

No plan survives contact with the PCs. If the scenes don't unfold in
that particular order, that's perfectly normal. The PCs will manage to
skip a scene through ingenuity, or make a scene irrelevant, or create a
new scene by following some tangent they came up with. Go with it! You
can always bring them back on track, or modify a previous scene on the
fly to create the new scene.

In fact, it makes your life easier to plan on scenes that can be
shuffled, combined, or removed so you can adjust them to fit the rhythm
at which your game is unfolding.

## Adventure Aspects

Now you can come up with your adventure aspects. Write two for each
scene: one for the location/setting, and one for the obstacle the PCs
will face. You can write more, but include at least these two. If the
PCs will face no obstacle, then there is no tension. The scene will be
boring and you need to delete it from your list. Even searching an
abandoned war camp for information is an obstacle, [_Hidden
Clues_].

> _Kim thinks about who stole Valius Nummus' manuscript and how hard it
> should be to track them. She wants to bring in some physical
> confrontation early on and also point to the waterfront so Isaac,
> whose character Ulf is not directly tied to the Mask of Kuldarus, will
> not be left out._

**Recovering the Manuscript: **_Discovering the identity of the thieves
and getting the manuscript back. Since the thieves used violence, there
is probably going to be a physical confrontation._

_Obstacle Aspect: [**Cheap Hired Brutes**]_

_Environmental Aspect: [**Dark Alleys Near the Waterfront**]_

## The Opposition

**Adventure Stats**

Adventures use the following stats, which you can think of as its
"skills" or "approaches":

**Combat: **This governs NPCs attacking, defending, and creating
advantages using combative maneuvers.

**Exploration: **This sets the difficulty of (or opposes) PC attempts to
interact with or move through the environment, whether that opposition
comes from an NPC or another obstacle in the setting. This covers
movement, investigating clues, discovering details, determining NPC
initiative, allowing something to remain hidden from the PCs, etc.

**Interaction: **This is rolled to have the NPCs interact with the PCs.

**[[Lore]]: **Governs how difficult it is to know some relevant information
that comes up in the adventure.

To set the adventure's stat ratings, set one of them at the same level
as the PC's highest approach rating +1 (called Hard difficulty), then
choose two to be at the same level as the PC's highest approach rating
-1 (called Average difficulty) and one to be -3 lower (called Easy
difficulty).

> _For instance, if the PCs' highest approach score is Good (+3), then
> you'd have a set-up of +4, +2, +2, +0. If you have an experienced
> group of PCs that have raised their approaches to Great (+4), then you
> would have a spread of_
>
> _+5, +3, +3, +1._

Choose the scores so that they highlight the important aspects you have
in mind for the adventure. Do you want this adventure to be a tough
fight with low social interaction? Have Combat be your Hard approach and
Interaction be Easy. Do you want a game of intrigue with next to no
fighting? Use [[Lore]] or Interaction as your Hard approaches and Combat as
your Easy approach.

This is what you'll be rolling for every NPC or setting element that
comes into play against the PCs.

> _The campaign is just beginning and the PCs' top approach score is
> Good (+3), so Kim assigns +4, +2, +2, and +0 to the adventure
> approaches. She doesn't want to make it too difficult to find the
> mask, so she sets Exploration at Mediocre (+0), and she wants a lot of
> the questions left at the end to revolve around motives and factions,
> so she sets Interaction at Great (+4). Combat and [[Lore]] will thus be at
> Fair (+2)._

**Divine Interest: **Bear in mind that in order to beat a Hard adventure
approach of +5, your group of heroes will have to roll high enough to
routinely risk "catastrophic success," a roll of +9 or higher, which
incurs Divine Interest. When you, the GM, select the Hard approach,
you're essentially deciding what, in this adventure, most risks
attracting the attention of the gods.

Conversely, when selecting the Easy adventure approach, you're nudging
the flow of the story by offering a place where the adventurers will
have an easier time succeeding.

### Characters and Creatures

The GM gets to play all the non-players characters or NPCs, be they
support, allies, contacts, etc. But some of the most important will be
those who present opposition for the PCs. You don't need to fill in a
character sheet for every one of them; jot down only what matters. We
have two main types of characters to track in the opposition: recurring
adversaries and minions.

**Adversaries: **When you make an adversary, you can choose to stat them
out exactly like the PCs, with approaches, aspects, stress, and
consequences. You should do this for important or recurring adversaries
who are intended to give the PCs some real difficulties, but you
shouldn't need more than one or two of these in a given scenario.

_Laetitia Bibulus ix Gailus and her ally Captain Volo Troll-Axe will
definitely be recurring adversaries, so Kim thinks she will write fairly
complete character sheets for them._

**Minions: **Other opponents are _minions_---unnamed soldiers, monsters,
or brutes that are there to make the PCs' day a little more difficult,
but they're designed to be more or less easily swept aside, especially
by powerful PCs. Here's how you create their stats:

1. Make a list of what this minion is skilled at. They get a Fair (+2)
   to all rolls dealing with these things.

2. Make a list of what this minion is bad at. They get a Terrible (−2)
   to all rolls dealing with these things.

3. Everything else gets a Mediocre (+0).

4. Minions use the Fractal Adventure's approaches (Combat,
   Exploration, Interaction, and [[Lore]]) as modified by their abilities.

5. Give the minion an aspect or two to reinforce what they're good and
   bad at, or if they have a particular strength or vulnerability.
   It's okay if a minion's aspects are really simple.

6. Minions have zero, one, or two boxes in their stress track,
   depending on how tough you imagine them to be.

7. Minions can't take consequences. If they run out of stress boxes
   (or don't have any), the next hit takes them down.

8. Give the minion a weight 0 if they are smaller than a Sentian, 1 if
   they are Sentian-sized, 2 if they are bigger than a Sentian, 4 if
   they are the size of a small building, and more if they are even
   bigger! Note: This weight represents their physical size. If they
   have a particularly impressive intellect or social skills you can
   mark their weight in other arenas as well. See the***"Weight"***
   section for more details.

_Since Volo Troll-Axe is captain of the _Skyhammer_, he must have a
crew, but we don't need much detail on any of them; they are
rank-and-file minions._

**Vidaar Sailor**

Weight:1 (Sentian-sized)

[_Vidaar Sailor_]; [_We Are Skyhammers!_]

**Skilled (+2) at: **Sailing, fighting with boarding axes, climbing in
the rigging.

**Bad (-2) at: **Planning, social situations.

Stress

o

Astute gamers will have noticed that using "skilled at" and "bad at"
are roughly the equivalent of giving minions a few stunts and flaws.

**Groups of Minions (a.k.a. Mobs): **If you have a lot of low-level
opponents facing the PCs, you can make your job easier by treating them
as a group---or maybe a few groups. Instead of tracking a dozen
individual opponents, you track three groups of four minions each. Each
of these groups acts like a single character and has a set of stats just
like a single minion would:

1. Choose a couple of things they're skilled at. You might designate
   "ganging up" as one of the things the group is good at.

2. Choose a couple of things they're not so good at.

3. Give them an aspect.

4. Give them the same stress an individual would have plus one stress
   box for every two individuals in the group.

5. Give the group a weight by adding up the weight of the individuals.
   This shouldn't go above 8. If it does, split them up into smaller
   groups.

_When several crew members are acting together against the PCs, Kim will
treat them as a group of rank-and-file minions. For example, a press
gang might look like this:_

Press Gang of the _Skyhammer_

Weight:6 (6 crew members that are Sentian-sized)

[_Press Gang_]; [_Vidaar Sailors_]; [_We Are
Skyhammers!_]

**Skilled (+2) at: **Finding derelict shore parties, fighting with
belaying pins, pressing civilians into service, ganging up.

**Bad (-2) at: **Standing up to organized groups, fighting when
outnumbered.

Stress

oooo (6 crew members)

A mob of minions can use its weight to surround or split the the group
of PCs. When it makes sense, the GM can treat a mob as a single
unit---instead of rolling dice individually for each of three Vidaar
brutes, just roll once for the whole mob.

Mobs typically have two to four stress boxes. When a mob takes enough
stress to reduce it to a single minion, try to have that orphaned minion
join up with another mob in the scene, if it makes sense. (If it
doesn't, just have them flee. Minions are good at that.)

**Swarms: **Remember swarms? We talked about them on page 225. Swarms
are groups of creatures which individually have a weight of 0, meaning
they're too small to be a serious threat to the average character (annoying, yes; a threat, no). But when they swarm, they can increase
their weight: a small swarm, the size of an average Sentian, is weight
1; a big swarm, one about the size of an Ur-Kuld, is weight 2; and a
huge swarm, one as big as a Marhn, is weight 4.

Well, that's not the only thing they can increase: they can also
increase their capacity to take harm. Small swarms typically have no
stress boxes (meaning they are taken out by the first point of harm),
big swarms have one stress box, and huge swarms have two or three.

### Adding Opposition to the Adventure

Go through the list of obstacle aspects you assigned to each scene, and
turn them into adversaries, minions, or at least adventure stunts (for
example, for a violent storm).

> Volo Troll-Axe as antagonists during the race to get the mask._
>
> _She has also listed as "live" opponents the cheap hired brutes who

> small boats_, and _Bad (-2) at everything else_. The tentacle monster

> avoiding attention from explorers_._

### Setting Difficulties

When another character is opposing a PC, their rolls provide the
opposition in a conflict, contest, or challenge. But if there's no
active opposition, you have to decide how hard the task is.

Fixed difficulties: Some difficulties are already pre-defined: roaring,
casting a ritual, moving multiple zones, etc. For those challenges, use
the difficulties already assigned.

Adventure Approaches: If the adventure approach is applicable, use that.
The heroes are exploring an island looking for an entrance to the secret
temple? Use the Exploration approach for the difficulty. Trying to
convince the angry spear-toting locals that they mean no harm? Use the
Interaction approach.

If neither of those is applicable, here are some guidelines for making
up difficulties on the fly:

Low difficulties are best when you want to give the PCs a chance to show
off and be awesome. Difficulties near their approach ratings are best
when you want to provide tension but not overwhelm them. High
difficulties are best when you want to emphasize how dire or unusual the
circumstances are and make them pull out all the stops.

**Rules of Thumb:** If the task isn't very tough at all, give it a
Mediocre (+0)---or just tell the player they succeed without a roll.

If you can think of at least one reason why the task is tough, pick Fair (+2).

If the task is extremely difficult, pick Great (+4).

If the task is impossibly difficult, go as high as you think makes
sense. The PC will need to drop some [[fate point]]s and get lots of help to
succeed, but that's fine.

In tense situations, any obstacle's difficulty can be set at two higher
than the Approach used to overcome, so it is likely to need an Invoke.

**Approaches and Difficulties:** Sometimes being Careful makes things a
lot easier; sometimes it just takes too long. The GM may wish to adjust
the target number up or down by 1 or 2 depending on whether you choose a
fitting or a problematic approach.

For example, there should be different difficulties, costs, and
repercussions depending on whether the PCs decide to Forcefully break
down a door, Sneakily pick the lock, or Cleverly come up with a
legitimate excuse to be let in.

## Set the First Scene

You've got the problem, the scenes, and the opposition. All you need
now is to open with a strong scene that will make the players want to
jump in and act. You want to create a strong opening situation that ties
to the problem, and some good antagonist characters with agendas. The
players' interactions with these will create the fiction.

Pick a book from your shelf of favorites that has a really good opening,
say within the first ten pages, and ask yourself why you think it was
strong. Usually, a scene that gets your attention swiftly has some
intriguing setting, some questions that pique the reader's curiosity
and are left open, and some sort of action scene or exciting event.

Now adapt these concepts to your adventure as needed. Look at your story
questions and pick one which you think will get the players' attention
immediately. If you don't see one in the list, it's time to ask more
questions! Whatever question you ask in the opening must make the
players want to answer.

Note that _**you don't actually have to start at the beginning**_.
Sometimes it's good to open with a short prologue, a flashback, even a
flash forward that will be followed by "Ten days earlier" in the next
scene. All of these are good, but you have to articulate them clearly so
the players can understand what you are doing.

Finally, remember that the game is about characters who are proactive,
competent, and dramatic. Even if you start with a scene that puts the
PCs on the defensive, don't describe them as being belittled or
disempowered.

That's it! You have your completed adventure, ready to share with your
players. Don't forget to roll with their punches, and keep things
fluid. Like most good outlines, this one is subject to change at a
moment's notice. Don't force the issue of your perfectly devised
plans. If the PCs get off-track, find a way to get them back to their
goal---the adventure's trouble aspect, the reason it was inevitable or
imperative that they pursue the goal, is a good motivator to get them
back on track. But if they are merely pursuing the goal in a way you had
not expected, let them!

### Getting Better At It

Once you grasp how it works, the Fractal Adventure method is quick and
straightforward to use when creating scenarios. The unified view makes
it easy for the GM to react quickly since there is no sheaf of notes to
thumb through, and having the adventure statted like a character makes
the GM more like another player at the game table, less like the CEO of
the gaming group.

Ultimately, if you are comfortable improvising in response to your
players' ideas, all you really need in an adventure is a strong opening
situation that ties to one of your issues, and some good antagonist
characters with agendas. The players' interactions with these will
create the fiction; the entire group will create scenes on the fly.
