# War of Ashes

![[menu-war-of-ashes.jpg]]

Welcome to the War of Ashes RPG: Fate of Agaptus! This "grimsical" minis-friendly tabletop RPG is based on the popular miniature game. Head off to adventure in a world where the inhabitants might look cute and cuddly but often carry pointy objects with which they might just decide to stab you. Play as a determined Elvorix, a vengeful Vidaar, a militaristic Jaarl, or a ravenous Kuld. Stage Romanic-style battles and then celebrate your victory with a pint of kogg.
