# Gods and Monsters

The world is young and majestic, and humans eke out a living and dream of civilization. But you are not like them: you are a god. A primal creature, your soul a blazing font of power, your body an expression of your nature. The more extreme your behavior the greater the power you can wield---but it is easy to become lost in a single facet of your existence and cross the line from god to monster.
