# Skills

The [[Burglary]], [[Lore]], and [[Stealth]] skills are not used. In their place, we
add Infiltrate, Mythology, and Science.

### Infiltrate

Infiltrate combines [[Burglary]] and [[Stealth]] from [[Fate Core]]. While being
sneaky is useful, it's not enough of a focus that characters should need
to invest in two skills to be good at different kinds of being sneaky.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Use Infiltrate to overcome obstacles related to avoiding
the notice of observers, getting into secured areas, and sneaking around
or generally being where you aren't supposed to be.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Infiltrate can be used to create advantages
related to being or remaining unseen, the element of surprise, knowledge
of a secured area or security measures, or other things.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Infiltrate isn't normally used to attack.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Infiltrate is rolled to oppose attempts to [[Notice]] you while
you're being sneaky, or to investigate your infiltration. You can also
roll it to defend against attempts to create advantages related to
highlighting you, drawing attention to you, or otherwise making you
conspicuous.

### Mythology

Mythology covers abstract, general knowledge of spirits and the
otherworld. It's perfectly possible to get by without this skill, so not
all mediums will have a high Mythology, or even any at all. It's of
little use in direct interaction with spirits, which is governed by the
common skill set. It's most useful for noticing or taking advantage of
hidden characteristics of the otherworld---common properties that happen
to be present, clues to its nature, or weaknesses an upset spirit might
be trying to hide.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Discover or recall hidden or obscure facts about the
otherworld and spirits, along with their applicability to present
circumstance.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Capitalize on hidden or obscure facts about or
properties of the otherworld or spirits that are relevant to the current
circumstance.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Mythology isn't normally used to attack.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Mythology isn't normally used to defend.

### Science

Science covers...science. The observational study and description of the
material world, and the application of that knowledge. Science is of no
help when dealing with the otherworld, or with the actions or effects of
spirits or spiritual interference. Science can rule out natural
explanations or help with fixing the consequences of a spirit's
meddling, but that's as far as it goes.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Apply scientific knowledge to remove an obstacle. While
flexible, Science always requires tools specialized for the task at
hand, unlike more personal skills such as [[Athletics]] and [[Physique]], and
using Science to solve problems often takes a lot of time.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Science is much more suited to creating
advantages. This usually means making an observation about the material
world and drawing some conclusion about it, which can then be leveraged
by using another skill.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Science isn't normally used to attack.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Science isn't normally used to defend.
