> ***Never let the rules get in the way of what makes narrative sense***. If you or the players narrate something in the game and it makes sense to apply a certain rule outside of the normal circumstances where you would do so, go ahead and do it.

The most common example of this has to do with consequences. The rules say that by default, a consequence is something a player chooses to take after getting hit by an attack in a conflict.

But say you’re in a scene where a player decides that, as part of trying to intimidate his way past someone, his PC is going to punch through a glass-top table with a bare fist.

Everyone likes the idea and thinks it’s cool, so no one’s interested in what happens if the PC fails the roll. However, everyone agrees that it also makes sense that the PC would injure his hand in the process (which is part of what makes it intimidating).

It’s totally fine to assign a mild consequence of [Glass in My Hand] in that case, because it fits with the narration, even though there’s no conflict and nothing technically attacked the PC.

As with [[The Golden Rule]], make sure everyone’s on the same page before you do stuff like this.

> Due to a failure on a previous roll, Cynere has accidentally set off a deadly magical trap while in pursuit of the Idol of Karlon-Kar, an ancient god of destruction. Amanda describes the hall as continually filled with fiery bolts of death, seemingly in a random configuration, with the pedestal holding the idol located on the far end of the hall from where Cynere's currently standing.
>
> Lily says, "Well, there's nothing for it. I'm going after the idol. I take off down the hall, keeping my eye out for fiery death bolts."
>
> Amanda thinks, because she knows that dice are going to have to come out on this. If Cynere is moving through the hall, it looks most like an overcome action to do the movement. But with the fiery death bolts in the room, it seems more like Lily would need to defend herself. There are also two ways she could handle the trap---it's technically just passive opposition against Lily to prevent her passing through the room safely, but because it can do damage, it seems more like an attack.
>
> So Amanda asks, "Lily, we need to go to dice, but what exactly do you want to accomplish here? Are you mainly trying to make sure you don't get hit, or are you blasting through the hall to get to the idol?"
>
> Lily doesn't hesitate. "Oh, the idol, for sure."
>
> Amanda asks, "So you're willing to take damage in the process?"
>
> Lily says, "Yeah. Throwing myself into danger as usual."
>
> Amanda says, "Okay, so we can do it in one roll. Here's how we'll handle it. You roll [[Athletics]] against Fantastic (+6) opposition. If you make it, you're through the trap and don't take any harm. If you don't make it, you're stuck in the hallway and will have to try again to make it all the way through. We're also going to treat that failure like a failed defense roll, so you're going to take a hit as well. Because of all the fiery death and whatnot."
>
> Lily winces, but nods and gathers up her dice.

In this example, Amanda combined effects from overcome and defend to determine what happens to Cynere. This is totally okay, because it fits their intent and it makes sense given the situation they described. She might have decided to do both rolls separately, and that would have been fine too---she just wanted to get it all into one roll.

If you're ever in doubt during play, come back to the Golden Rule and remember that you have the flexibility to do the same kind of thing as you need to. Just make sure that when you do this, you and the players are on the same page.
