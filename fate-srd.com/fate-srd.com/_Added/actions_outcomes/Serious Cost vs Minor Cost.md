# Serious Cost Vs. Minor Cost

When you're thinking about costs, think both about the story in play and
the game mechanics to help you figure out what would be most
appropriate.

## Serious Cost

A serious cost should make the current situation worse somehow, either
by creating a new problem or exacerbating an existing one. Bring in
another source of opposition in this scene or the next one (such as a
new opposing NPC or an obstacle to overcome), or ask the player to take
a consequence at their lowest free level, or give someone who opposes
the PC an advantage with a free invocation.

## Minor Cost

A minor cost should add a story detail that's problematic or bad for the
PC, but doesn't necessarily endanger progress. You could also ask the PC
to take stress or give someone who opposes the PCs a boost.

It's okay if the minor cost is mainly a narrative detail, showing how
the PC just barely scratched by. See more advice about dealing with
costs on in [[Running the Game]].
