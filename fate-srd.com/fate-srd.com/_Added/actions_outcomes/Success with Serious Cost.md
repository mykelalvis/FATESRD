# Succeed at a Cost

You can also offer to give the PCs what they want, but at a price---in this case, the failed roll means they weren't able to achieve their goals without consequence.

**A minor cost should complicate the PC's life.** Like the above suggestion, this focuses on using failure as a means to change up the situation a bit, rather than just negating whatever the PC wanted. Some suggestions:

- Foreshadow some imminent peril. _"The lock opens with a soft click, but the same can't be said for the vault door. If they didn't know you were here before, they sure do now."_
- Introduce a new wrinkle. _"Yes, the Guildmaster is able to put you  in touch with a mage who can translate the withered tome---a guy named Berthold. You know him, actually, but the last time you saw him was years ago, when he caught you with his wife."_
- Present the player with a tough choice. _"You brace the collapsing ceiling long enough for two of the others to get through safely, but not the rest. Who's it going to be?"_
- Place an aspect on the PC or the scene. _"Somehow you manage to land on your feet, but with a_ [Twisted Ankle] _as a souvenir."_
- Give an NPC a boost. _"Nikolai surprises you a bit by agreeing to your offer, but he does so with a wry smile that makes you uneasy. Clearly, Nikolai Has A Plan."_
- Check one of the PC's stress boxes. Careful with this one---it's only a real cost if the PC's likely to take more hits in the same scene. If you don't think that's going to happen, go with another choice.

## Success at a Serious Cost
**A serious cost does more than complicate the PC's life or promise something worse to come**---it takes a serious and possibly irrevocable toll, right now.

One way you can do this is by taking a minor cost to the next level. Instead of suspecting that a guard heard them open the vault, a few guards burst in the room, weapons drawn. Instead of being merely cut off from their allies by a collapsing ceiling, one or more of those allies ends up buried in the debris. Instead of merely having to face an awkward situation with Berthold, he's still angry and out for their blood.

Other options could include:

- Reinforce the opposition. You might clear one of an NPC's stress boxes, improve one of their skills by one step for the scene, or give them a new aspect with a free invocation.
- Bring in new opposition or a new obstacle, such as additional enemies or a [[situation aspect]] that worsens the situation.
- Delay success. The task at hand will take much longer than expected.
- Give the PC a consequence that follows logically from the circumstances---mild if they have one available, moderate if they don't.

If you're stuck for just how serious a serious cost should be, you may want to use the margin of failure as a gauge. For instance, in the vault-opening example, above---the one where the guards hear the PC and burst in the room---if the player failed their [[Burglary]] roll by 1 or 2, the PCs outnumber the guards. Not a tough fight, but a fight nonetheless. If they failed it by 3 to 5, it's an even match, one that's likely to use up resources like [[fate point]]s or consequences. But if they failed by 6 or more, they're outnumbered and in real danger.
