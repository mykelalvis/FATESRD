# Create an Advantage

[[Four Actions]]

**Use the create advantage action to make a [[situation aspect]] that gives you a benefit, or to claim a benefit from any aspect you have access to.**

The create advantage action covers a broad range of endeavors, unified around the theme of using your skills to take advantage (hence the name) of the environment or situation you're in.

Sometimes, that means you're doing something to actively change your circumstances (like throwing sand in an opponent's eyes or setting something on fire), but it could also mean that you're discovering new information that helps you (like learning the weakness of a monster through research), or taking advantage of something you've previously observed (like your opponent's predisposition to a bad temper).

When you roll to create an advantage, you must specify whether you're creating a new [[situation aspect]] or taking advantage of an aspect that's already in place. If the former, are you attaching that [[situation aspect]] to a character or to the environment?

Opposition might be active or passive, depending on the circumstances. If your target is another character, their roll always counts as a [[#defend]] action.

If you're using create advantage to make a new aspect...

- **When you fail**, you either don't create the aspect, or you create it but someone else gets the free invoke---whatever you end up doing works to someone else's advantage instead. That could be your opponent in a conflict, or any character who could tangibly benefit to your detriment. You may have to reword the aspect to show that the other character benefits instead---work it out with the recipient in whichever way makes the most sense.
- **When you tie**, you get a boost instead of the [[situation aspect]] you were going for. This might mean you have to rename the aspect a bit to reflect its temporary nature ([Rough Terrain] becomes [Rocks on the Path]).
- **When you succeed**, you create a [[situation aspect]] with a free invocation.
- **When you succeed with style**, you get a [[situation aspect]] with two free invocations instead of one.

> While deep in the Caverns of Yarzuruk, Cynere is in the unfortunate position of having to fight some animated temple golems.
>
> The first couple of [[exchange]]s have not gone well, and she's taken a couple of big hits already. Lily says, "Amanda, you said there was a lot of filigree and furnishings and stuff laying around, right?"
>
> Amanda nods, and Lily asks, "Can I knock some of it over in order to trip these guys up a bit? I imagine if they're big, clodhopping golems, they aren't as agile as I am."
>
> She says, "Sounds fine to me. Sounds like you're trying to create advantage with [[Athletics]]. One of the golems gets to roll a defend action against you, just because it's close enough to get in your way."
>
> Cynere has [[Athletics]] at Great (+4). Lily rolls and gets a +1, for a Superb (+5) result. The nearest golem rolls to defend and only gets a Fair (+2). Cynere succeeds with style! Lily places the aspect [Cluttered Floor] on the scene and notes that she can invoke that aspect twice for free.
>
> Amanda describes the golems' difficulty with their footing, and now Cynere's got a little bit of an advantage in the coming exchange...

If you're using create advantage on an existing aspect...

- **When you fail**, you give a free invoke on that aspect to someone else instead. That could be your opponent in a conflict, or any character who could tangibly benefit to your detriment.
- **When you tie or succeed**, you place a free invocation on the aspect.
- **When you succeed with style**, you place two free invocations on the aspect.

> Zird is approaching a local merchant he's been hired to get close to (i.e. spy on) for the sultan of Wanir, in the famous bazaar of Wanir's capital city.
>
> Ryan says, "I'm going to use [[Rapport]] to create an advantage, get this guy to open up to me. I don't know what I'm looking for in terms of an aspect---just some juicy observation I can use later or pass on to Cynere." He has the Friendly Liar stunt, so he can do this without needing [[Deceive]], despite the fact that he's hiding his real intent.
>
> Amanda says, "Works for me. He's a merchant, so his [[Deceive]]'s pretty high. I'm going to say it's passive opposition, though, because he's not really suspicious of you. Try and beat a Great (+4)."
>
> Ryan rolls. His [[Rapport]] skill is Good (+3), and he manages a +1 on the dice, for a tie.
>
> Amanda looks at her notes, grins, and says, "Okay, here's what you notice. This merchant is obviously a very social fellow, boisterously engaging other shop owners and potential customers as he makes his rounds. This geniality takes on more of a flirtatious, suggestive air any time he speaks to young men---he can't seem to help that."
>
> She slides an index card with the aspect [Sucker for a Pretty Man] written on it, to indicate that the merchant's aspect is now public. Ryan notes that he has a free invocation on that aspect.
>
> "Pretty man, huh?" Ryan says. "Does he think I'm pretty?"
>
> Amanda grins. "He certainly thinks you're friendly..."
>
> Ryan rolls his eyes. "The things I do for business..."
