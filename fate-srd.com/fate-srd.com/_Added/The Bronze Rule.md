> ***In Fate, you can treat anything in the game world like it’s a character. Anything can have aspects, skills, stunts, stress tracks, and consequences if you need it to.***

We call this the Bronze Rule, but you may also have heard of it as the Fate Fractal if you pay attention to the Internet. We’ve already seen some examples of this earlier in the book; you give your game its own aspects during creation, you place situation aspects on the environment as well as on characters, and the GM can let environmental hazards attack as if they had skills.

See [[What To Do During Play#Environmental Hazards|environmental hazards]], [[The Silver Rule]], and [[The Golden Rule]]

The following is extracted from the [[Fate System Toolkit]]

There's one more thing you should ask yourself before you make an entirely new rule for something---can I represent this with the Bronze Rule?

In Fate, you can treat pretty much anything as if it were a character. Your gun? Sure. The storm outside? Absolutely. The scene itself? Why not? You can give anything aspects, skills, stunts, and stress boxes, and here's the thing that makes this technique really cool---they don't have to be the same ones the PCs get. It doesn't make sense for the storm outside to have [[Fight]] and [[Physique]], but what about Cold and Sleet? Your gun doesn't need a physical or mental stress track, but what about an ammo stress track? And scenes already have aspects all over the place!

If you can represent a new thing as a character, it's typically easier to do that than to create a new rule out of whole cloth. Not _everything_ works this way, and there are some things you might not want to represent this way, but it's a powerful tool that you can apply to a wide variety of situations.

There's another extension of this technique---new rules for characters can be represented using the existing components of a character. You can represent magic through skills, super powers using aspects or stunts, and being corrupted by an ancient and seductive force with a stresstrack.

The following, nearly identical to the above, was extracted from [[Extras]]

## The Bronze Rule, aka The Fate Fractal

Before going any further, here's something important:

**In Fate, you can treat anything in the game world like it's a character. Anything can have aspects, skills, stunts, stress tracks, and consequences if you need it to.**

This is called this the Bronze Rule, but you may also have heard of it as the Fate Fractal if you pay attention to the Internet. You've already seen some examples of this in other places on the site; you give your game its own aspects during creation, you place situation aspects on the environment as well as on characters, and the GM can let [[What To Do During Play#Environmental Hazards|environmental hazards]] attack as if they had skills.

Extras extend the Bronze rule even further.
