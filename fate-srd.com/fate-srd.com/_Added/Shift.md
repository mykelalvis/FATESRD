# Shift

A shift, per [[fate-core#Interpreting Results|the basic resolution rules]], is the number that you _exceeded_ a target difficulty by.

If the target is `+4` and your total (after all rolling and additions and subtractions) is `+4`, then this is a [[Tie]] and thus worth zero shifts ( `+0` ).
If you had rolled a `+6`, the you would have had _two shifts_ (`+6` - `+4` = `2`) and would have had a [[Success]].
If you had rolled more than `+6`, such as a `+9`, you would have had _more than 2 shifts_ (`3` in this case) and would have had [[Success with Style]]

There is effectively no such thing as "negative shifts".
