# Invisibility

Sorry, who said that?

**Basic Invisibility:** You can completely fade from view, including your clothes and anything you're carrying. Cameras and similar devices cannot detect you at all, and you gain +2 to [[Stealth]] against being seen by living targets.

### Enhancements

**Master Invisibility:** You gain an additional +2 bonus to [[Stealth]] against being seen.

**Sharable Invisibility:** You can render other objects invisible along with you. This includes other people, pieces of furniture, or even walls. You must maintain contact with the invisible object.

**Precise Invisibility:** You don't need to turn invisible all at once; you can make parts of yourself invisible, like your head or arms, or keep objects you're holding invisible while you can be seen.

### Common Power Synergies

**Phasing:** When you're invisible, you're practically a ghost, able to walk through walls.

**Illusion:** You are the master of what is seen and unseen.

### Drawbacks

- Your invisibility is not actually visual; your power works by effectively writing yourself out of the minds of those around you. Unfortunately, you still have a [Completely Visible Reflection].
- Your power is a reflection of your personality: you were always a meek, background sort of person, even before you learned to fade from view. You are [Easily Forgotten], even by your companions.
- Unfortunately, your invisibility is only skin deep, it [Doesn't Work on Clothes].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Hyper-Visibility:** You can apply your power in reverse, turning the world dim and making you the most visible thing around for several minutes. During this time you are extremely noticeable; anyone in your zone or an adjacent zone must overcome a Great (+4) obstacle with [[Investigate]] to see anything other than you.

**Perfect Evasion:** If you are in a conflict, you can duck briefly out of sight and turn invisible to evade everyone's notice. On any subsequent turn of yours, you can appear in any zone. Furthermore, if you attack a target in your zone on the turn you reappear, you gain +4 to that attack. Alternately, you can just leave the conflict. Unfortunately, your sudden disappearance will make your enemies more paranoid, which may encourage them to call in reinforcements.
