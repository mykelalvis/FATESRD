# Super Intelligence

You are the smartest person in the room, whatever room you happen to be in.

**Basic Super Intelligence:** You gain +2 to [[Will]] when working though puzzles, riddles, or other mentally absorbing tasks. In addition, you can answer complicated mathematical problems instantly.

### Enhancements

**Master Super Intelligence:** You gain an additional +2 to [[Will]] when demonstrating your mental acuity.

**Walking Library:** You've forgotten more than most people will ever know. By spending a [[fate point]], you can use [[Will]] in place of [[Lore]] and gain the bonus to [[Will]] from Super Intelligence, even if it's not a mentally absorbing task.

**Chessmastery:** You don't just understand facts; you understand how people operate. You gain +2 to [[Empathy]] when attempting to predict someone's future actions.

**Taskmastery:** Once you see how someone fights, you can exploit their weaknesses. When someone deals physical stress to you in a conflict, you gain +2 to all attack rolls against them until the end of the scene.

### Common Power Synergies

**Precognition:** Your intelligence is so far beyond the norm that you can predict the near-future with uncanny accuracy.

**Influence:** People are just complex systems that a clever mind can manipulate with the right words, and your clever mind always knows just what to say.

**Natural Weapon:** Your fists are no stronger than anyone else's, but your ability to read an opponent means you know exactly where to strike for maximum effect.

### Drawbacks

- Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's sometimes difficult for the very brilliant to get along with the more normal. You [Think You're Better than Everyone].
- Your brain just. Doesn't. Shut. Off. Because of your endlessly bubbling, productive mind, you are [Intensely Sleep-Deprived].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Pawn Interception:** You can use your gift for analysis to divert an incoming attack. When an attack would hit you, you can have it instead strike a nameless NPC in your zone---they just happened to wander into the line of fire at the exact right moment. When this happens, you take no damage and the NPC is taken out.

**Battle Plan:** Your tactical mind has figured out exactly how a given conflict will shape up---you just need to remind your companions what to do. You can shout out a battle plan to give yourself and every ally in the scene the boost [We've Planned for This]. Unfortunately, doing so will
give whomever you're fighting a little insight into your tactics.
