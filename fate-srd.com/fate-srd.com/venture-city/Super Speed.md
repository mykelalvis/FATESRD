Venture City

# Super Speed

Gotta go fast, gotta go fast!

**Basic Super Speed:** You gain +2 to [[Athletics]] rolls that involve moving quickly. Additionally, you can move quickly enough to run across liquids or up sheer vertical surfaces---although if you slow down or stop, you'll fall.

### Enhancements

**Master Super Speed:** You are faster than fast! Gain an additional +2 bonus to [[Athletics]] when moving quickly.

**Improved Reaction Time:** You can use [[Athletics]] in place of any other skill for the purpose of determining turn order.

### Common Power Synergies

**Phasing:** By concentrating carefully, you can accelerate the molecules in your body to such a point that they no longer interact with common, unaccelerated matter.

**Natural Weapon:** When you fight, you might not hit harder than anyone else, but you get a whole flurry of hits in at once, which is just as good.

**Super Intelligence:** It's not just your body that moves quickly; your mind also operates at light speed.

### Improved Special Effects

**Lots of Actions:** You can split your [[shift]]s among up to three different actions, adding +1 to each.

### Drawbacks

- Even a super-speedster gets tired, and when your hyperactive metabolism is on the downswing, you can suffer from intense [Burnout].
- In your world, people are moving in slow motion; they take forever to do the simplest tasks. No wonder you are so [Easily Distracted].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Quantum Tunneling:** If pressed, you can run fast enough to break through time itself. You and anyone and anything you are holding onto disappear completely, reappearing in the same position in the future---as little as one exchange later, but up to a week, with no time having passed for you. The spontaneous return to the natural flow of time, however, is sudden and potentially violent.

**Speed Demon:** If you're willing to tear up the streets---shattering glass, injuring pedestrians, and such---you can travel pretty much anywhere in the same city in the span of a single exchange.
