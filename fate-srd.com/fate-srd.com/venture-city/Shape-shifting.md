# Shape-Shifting

You are what you want to be.

**Basic Shape-Shifting:** You can change your form into that of any creature. You can use [[Will]] to [[create advantage]] of [Creature Form]. The opposition is generally Fair (+2), though it increases for particularly large or small shapes and for complex transformations like a swarm of bees. Your new shape persists until you decide to end it or get taken out.

### Enhancements

**Master Shape-Shifting:** You gain +2 to [[Will]] when attempting to change your shape.

**Skill-Shifting:** When you change your shape, select one skill. Gain +2 to that skill as long as you remain in creature form.

**Rapid Shifting:** Changing your form is nearly instant; it does not take an action.

### Common Power Synergies

**Flight:** With a little fine control over your shape-shifting ability, you can sprout wings whenever you need them.

**Animal Control:** Your time being an animal has taught you to think like an animal---and consequently, how to order an animal around.

### Drawbacks

- Your transformations aren't perfect; whenever you return to human shape, some animal features remain. [You Don't Look Quite Human].
- While your transformations are impressive, you can only tweak your form a little bit; you can't change it entirely. You are [Limited to Terrestrial Mammals].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**T-Rex:** You can turn into a giant dinosaur or similarly massive force of destruction, able to crush everything around you. You can only hold this form for a few minutes, though, and you're sure to tear up everything around you. While massive, you gain +1 to attack rolls and your attacks are Weapon:2.

**Stegosaurus:** You can turn yourself into an armored dinosaur or similarly unstoppable juggernaut, unfazed by anything around you. You can only hold this form for a few minutes, though, and you're sure to crush everything around you. While armored, you gain +2 to defend rolls and can knock down obstacles like thick concrete walls just by walking through them.
