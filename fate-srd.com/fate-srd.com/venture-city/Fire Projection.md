# Fire Projection

You like fire. Fire likes you. It doesn't have to get more complex than that to be fun.

**Basic Fire Projection:** Your powers are infused with flame, creating fireballs and billowing smoke when you use them.

### Enhancements

**Friend to Flames:** You cannot be harmed by fire of any sort, whether you generated it with your power or not.

**Fire Control:** In addition to generating fire, you can manipulate it, causing flames to spread where you want them to. Getting flames to spread in a specific direction requires you to overcome a Fair (+2) obstacle with [[Provoke]]; more complex fire maneuvers increase that opposition.

**Hot Blooded:** Whenever someone successfully attacks you using [[Fight]], they take 1 physical stress due to the sheer heat pouring off of you.

### Improved Special Effects

**Flame On:** You light yourself on fire. It's GREAT. You gain the [[situation aspect]] [On Fire] with one free invoke. If you are already [On Fire], gain another free invoke and clear your highest marked physical stress box.

### Common Power Synergies

**Energy Blast:** Fire is good. Fireballs are better.

**Flight:** Heat rises, right? So if you surround yourself in flames, you can coast on your own thermals.

### Drawbacks

- Some personality traits just go well with the ability to summon flames. You are [Hot-Tempered].
- You aren't wreathed in flames at all times, but you're never entirely extinguished; even if it's just a little smoke drifting from your hair, you are [Always On Fire].
- You can induce a small flame to become huge, but you can't create fire from nothing at all. At a minimum, [You Need a Spark].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Flaming:** You can surround yourself in flames that burn everything and everyone. Fires start near you, and anyone who touches you gets a mild physical consequence, or 1 physical stress if they don't have the open slot. This effect lasts until the end of the scene, but you can end it at will.
