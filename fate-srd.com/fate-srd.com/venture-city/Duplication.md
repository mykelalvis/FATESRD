# Duplication

You can be an entire team, all by yourself.

**Basic Duplication:** Once per scene, you can create a copy of yourself up to one zone away. This copy has your aspects and skills, but it takes a -1 penalty to all rolls. The duplicate is not an NPC, but another character under your control. During a conflict, both you and your copy get a free movement, but only one of you can take an action. You may dismiss the copy at will, or it will fade away on its own at the end of the scene. Your duplicate has its own physical stress boxes and consequence slots for physical damage. If your duplicate would take mental stress, you take it instead.

### Enhancements

**Master Duplication:** You can create a copy an additional time per scene, even while you already have a copy present.

**Effective Duplication:** Your duplicates do not take a penalty on rolls.

**Disposable Duplicates:** Your duplicates have no sense of self-preservation, so they shrug off minor injuries. They gain Armor:2 against physical attacks.

### Common Power Synergies

**Teleportation:** By creating a duplicate some distance away and then willing away your original body, your consciousness jumps into the spare body, effectively teleporting you. There are metaphysical concerns here, but you try not to think about them.

**Energy Blast:** You...there's no clean way to put this. You can try to create a copy of yourself inside someone else. It's unsettling. But effectively it works like throwing a blast of energy at them.

### Improved Special Effect

**Duplicate Action:** You can split your [[shift]]s between two different actions, each performed by a separate iteration of you. Your duplicate cannot succeed with style in this way, and the opposition to its action can't be higher than the opposition to your action.

### Drawbacks

- You would think that you and your duplicate get along smashingly, but you don't. Trouble brews when you [Don't Get Along with Yourself].
- Your duplicates are, if anything, too perfect. Sure, you don't get hurt when they do, but you do [Feel Their Pain].
- It would be great to send duplicates off on adventures without you, but when they get a hundred yards away from you they just fall over, dead. You have [Short-Range Control].

### Collateral Damage Effects

**Army of Me:** It's exhausting, but you can duplicate yourself well beyond your stated limits...at the expense of your ability to control them. This creates a swarm of you-NPCs under the GM's control.

**Extra Copies:** You can make an extra clone of yourself, even after you've reached your limit for the scene. It's straining to create these new clones, though, so something goes wrong: they burst in knocking things around, or move sluggishly and clumsily, or just aren't right.
