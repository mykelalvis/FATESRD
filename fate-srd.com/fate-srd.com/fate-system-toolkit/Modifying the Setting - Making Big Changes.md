# Modifying the Setting: Making Big Changes

While Fate characters are always protagonists, sometimes the players
decide they want to modify the setting itself, cleaning up the mean
streets of a crime-ridden town or securing a military fortification
against future attacks.

## Discover the Problems Before You Solve Them

First, the players must gather the information they need to do the job.
Perhaps the characters need to collect their existing
experience---"Isn't Bastion the main drug runner in town?"---or maybe
they need to make new [[Contacts]], [[Investigate]], or [[Lore]] rolls to uncover
old alliances and lost knowledge. Either way, the group should construct
a series of **setting aspects** that represent the existing problem.

> To clean up the streets, a group might list:
>
> - [Local Drug Pushers]
> - [Midlevel Drug Mules]
> - [Drug Financiers]
> - [Corrupt Cops]
> - [Crime Kingpin, Marty O'Banner]

## Episode by Episode

For each setting aspect the group wants to reform, the group must roll
against an appropriate difficulty for resolving that problem. For
example, arresting all the [Local Drug Pushers] might require
the characters to make a [[Resources]] roll to mobilize the existing police
officers, or a [[Physique]] roll to actually capture the bad guys
themselves. While the characters can invoke their own aspects, the GM
can pay [[fate point]]s to invoke the existing setting aspects---such as
[Corrupt Cops]---complicating the players' progress.

For each roll, use the outcome to drop the characters into the middle of
a situation---like a TV episode---that reflects the results of the roll.
On a losing roll, the [Local Drug Pushers] have gone to ground,
and it's going to take some digging to get them out. On a successful
roll, the group has rounded up the bad guys, but needs to get them to
start talking. Either way, if the characters manage to resolve the
situation, flip the setting aspect to a positive, turning [Local Drug
Pushers] into [A Few Clean Streets].

Once they start to make progress, let the group freely invoke previously
resolved setting aspects that apply, as the job might get easier when
they work their way up the chain.

## We Need a Montage!

If you're less interested in playing out the day-to-day changes needed
to reform a criminal justice system or fortify a castle, you can instead
construct montages for your characters' progress. Set a time
limit---including a limited number of actions---that represent that time
and resources the characters have available to resolve the situation
before the story picks up in full.

For each roll, the characters attempt to resolve one of the discovered
aspects using appropriate skills. Characters can work together, or they
can split up to try to solve multiple problems. In this style of making
big changes, narrate the group's success like a movie montage, pausing
only long enough at each roll to see the group succeed or fail to
improve the situation.
