# Movement

In a conflict, it's important to track where everyone is relative to one another, which is why the environment is divided into zones. Where you have zones, you have people trying to move around in them in order to get at one another or at a certain objective.

Normally, it's no big deal to move from one zone to another---**if there's nothing preventing you from doing so, you can move one zone in addition to your action for the exchange.**

If you want to move more than one zone (up to anywhere else on the map), if a [[situation aspect]] suggests that it might be difficult to move freely, or if another character is in your way, then you must make an [[Four Actions#Overcome|overcome]] action using [[Athletics]] to move.  This counts as your action for the exchange.

GMs, just as with other overcome rolls, you'll set the difficulty. You might use the number of zones the character is moving or the situation aspects in the way as justification for how high you set passive opposition. If another character is impeding the path, roll active opposition and feel free to invoke obstructing situation aspects in aid of their defense.

If you fail that roll, whatever was impeding you keeps you from moving.  If you tie, you get to move, but your opponent takes a temporary advantage of some kind. If you succeed, you move without consequence. If you succeed with style, you can claim a boost in addition to your movement.

> In our continuing warehouse conflict, Cynere wants to go after one of Og's thugs, who has started shooting arrows down from the second floor. That requires her to cross one zone to get to the access ladder for the second floor, and then climb it, making her opponent two zones away.
>
> She's currently mixing it up with a thug herself, whose [[Fight]] is at Fair (+2).
>
> Lily tells Amanda her intent, and Amanda says, "Okay, the thug you're fighting is going to try and keep you from getting away, so he's going to provide active opposition."
>
> Cynere's [[Athletics]] is Great (+4). She rolls and gets +0, for a Great result. The thug rolls his opposition, and rolls --1, for a result of Average (+1). That gives Cynere three [[shift]]s, and a success with style.
>
> Lily and Amanda describe Cynere faking out the thug, vaulting over a crate, and taking the ladder two rungs at a time to get up top. She takes a boost, which she calls [Momentum].
>
> The thug up top swallows hard, bringing his crossbow to bear...
