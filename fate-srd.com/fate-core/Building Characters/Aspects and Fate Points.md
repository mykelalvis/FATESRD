# Aspects & Fate Points

## Defining Aspects

An aspect is a phrase that describes something unique or noteworthy about whatever it's attached to. They're the primary way you spend and gain [[fate point]]s, and they influence the story by providing an opportunity for a character to get a bonus, complicating a character's life, or adding to another character's roll or passive opposition.

## Defining Fate Points

GMs and players, you both have a pool of points called [[fate point]]s you can use to influence the game. You represent these with tokens, as we mentioned in [[The Basics]]. Players, you start with a certain number of points every scenario, equal to your character's refresh. You'll also reset to your refresh rate if you ended a mid-scenario session with fewer [[fate point]]s than your rate. GMs, [[Fate Point Economy|you get a budget of fate points]] to spend in every scene.

When your [[aspect]]s come into play, you will usually spend or gain a [[fate point]].
