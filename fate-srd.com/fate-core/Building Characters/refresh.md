# Refresh

Refresh is the _minimum_ number of [[fate points]] a character will start each session with.  If the character left the last session with fewer [[fate points]] than their refresh rating, they automatically receive enough to equal their Refresh.

A player character in Fate starts with a refresh of 3. That means he'll start each session off with at least 3 [[fate points]].

## During Character Creation

Refresh is spent to acquire [[Stunts and Refresh]]s.  During creation, a character typically gets to choose 3 stunts.  If you pick four stunts, you spent one refresh and your refresh is 2. If you pick five stunts, your refresh is 1.

**Note:** some Fate games will change this setup. Regardless of how stunts work in your game, you can never have a refresh lower than 1.   You can adjust these defaults if you want to, and give out more free stunts if you want the PCs to have a lot of cool tricks and special bonuses. You can also change the default refresh rate---higher refresh means that the PCs won't need to take compels as often (think 4-color superhero comics), and lower refresh means they'll need to take several early in every session in order to have a decent supply (think _Die Hard_). Also, the higher your refresh, the more likely it is that players will buy stunts.
