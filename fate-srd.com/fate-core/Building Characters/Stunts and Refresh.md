[[Fate Core]]

# Stunts & Refresh

Pick or invent three to five stunts. Determine how many [[fate point]]s you start play with.

[[Stunt]]s change how skills work for your character. Picking and inventing stunts are covered in the [[Stunt]]s section.

You get three stunts for free, and you can take up to two more stunts at the cost of lowering your refresh by one each. (The gist is this: the more cool tricks you can do, the more you'll need to accept compels to get [[fate point]]s.) Figuring out stunts can take a while, so you may want to pick one for now and [[the Phase Trio|determine the rest of them during play]].

> [!info]- Example
> Lily decides to take the `Warmaster` stunt as one of her freebies: +2 to [[Fight]] rolls made to [[Create Advantage]] against an opponent, provided the opponent has a fighting style or weakness she can exploit.
>
> For her remaining free stunts, she picks `Second-Story Girl` and `Danger Sense`. You can see the write-ups for these on her character sheet.

You can choose to adjust [[refresh]] down if you want more stunts.  You can spend one refresh for one [[stunt]], but refresh is not allowed to go below 1.
