# High Concept

This is an [[aspect]] that describes _who you are_.

First, decide on your character's high concept. This is a single phrase or sentence that neatly sums up your character, saying who you are, what you do, what your "deal" is. When you think about your high concept, try to think of two things: how this aspect could help you, and how it might make things harder for you. Good high concept aspects do both.

**Examples**: `Feline Captain of Cirrus Skimmer`; `Suncaller of the Andral Desert`; `Chief Field Agent of IGEMA`
