## The Ladder

Fate uses a ladder of adjectives and numbers to rate the dice results, a character's skills and the result of a roll.

Here's the ladder:

| Number | Adjective |
| ------ | --------- |
| +8     | Legendary |
| +7     | Epic      |
| +6     | Fantastic |
| +5     | Superb    |
| +4     | Great     |
| +3     | Good      |
| +2     | Fair      |
| +1     | Average   |
| +0     | Mediocre  |
| -1     | Poor      |
| -2     | Terrible  |

It doesn't really matter which side of the ladder you use---some people remember the words better, some people remember the numbers better, and some people like using both. So you could say, "I got a Great," or "I got a +4," and it means the same thing. As long as everyone understands what you're communicating, you're fine.

Results can go below and above the ladder. It is encouraged that you to come up with your own names for results above Legendary, such as "Zounds!" and "Ridiculously Awesome."
