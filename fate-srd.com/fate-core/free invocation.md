# Free invocations


You don't always have to pay a [[fate point]] to invoke an aspect---sometimes it's free.

When you succeed at [[Create Advantage]], you "stick" a [[free invocation]] onto an aspect. If you succeed with style, you get two invocations. Some of the other actions also give you free [[boost]]s.

You also get to stick a [[free invocation]] on any consequences you inflict in a conflict.

[[Free invocation]]s work like normal ones except in two ways: no [[fate point]]s are exchanged, and you can stack them with a normal invocation for a better bonus. So you can use a [[free invocation]] and pay a [[fate point]] on the same aspect to get a +4 bonus instead of a +2, two rerolls instead of one, or you can add +4 to another character's roll or increase passive opposition by +4. Or you could split the benefits, getting a reroll and a +2 bonus. You can also stack multiple [[free invocation]]s together.

After you've used your [[free invocation]], if the aspect in question is still around, you can keep invoking it by spending [[fate point]]s.

> [!info]- Example
> Cynere succeeds on an attack, and causes her opponent to take the [Cut Across the Gut] consequence. On the next exchange, she attacks him again, and she can invoke that for free because she put it there, giving her a +2 or a reroll.

If you want, you can pass your [[free invocation]] to another character.  That allows you to get some teamwork going between you and a buddy. This is really useful in a conflict if you want to set someone up for a big blow---have everyone [[Create Advantage]] and pass their [[free invocation]]s onto one person, then that person stacks all of them up at once for a huge bonus.

### For Veterans

In other Fate games, [[free invocation]]s were called "tagging." This was one bit of jargon too many. You can still call it that if you want---whatever helps you and your table understand the rule.
