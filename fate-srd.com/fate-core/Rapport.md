[[Fate Core]]

# [[Rapport]]

The [[Rapport]] skill is all about making positive connections to people and eliciting positive emotion. It's the skill of being liked and trusted.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Use [[Rapport]] to charm or inspire people to do what you want, or to establish a good connection with them. Charm your way past the guard, convince someone to take you into their confidence, or become the man of the hour at the local tavern. For nameless NPCs, this is just an overcome action, but you may have to enter a contest to sufficiently ingratiate yourself to a named NPC or PC.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Use [[Rapport]] to establish a positive mood on a target or in a scene or to get someone to confide in you out of a genuine sense of trust. You could pep talk someone into having Elevated Confidence, or stir a crowd into a [Joyful Fervor], or simply make someone [Talkative] or [Helpful].

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: [[Rapport]] doesn't cause harm, so you don't use it for attacks.

[D][[Defend]]: [[Rapport]] defends against any skill used to damage your reputation, sour a mood you've created, or make you look bad in front of other people. It does not, however, defend against mental attacks. That requires [[Will]].

## [[Rapport]] Stunts

- **Best Foot Forward**. Twice per session, you may upgrade a boost you receive with [[Rapport]] into a full [[situation aspect]] with a free invocation.
- **Demagogue**. +2 to [[Rapport]] when you're delivering an inspiring speech in front of a crowd. (If there are named NPCs or PCs in the scene, you may target them all simultaneously with one roll rather than dividing up your [[shift]]s.)
- **Popular**. If you're in an area where you're popular and well-liked, you can use [[Rapport]] in place of [[Contacts]]. You may be able to establish your popularity by spending a [[fate point]] to declare a story detail, or because of prior justification.
