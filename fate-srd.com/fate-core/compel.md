# Compelling Aspects

If you're in a situation where having or being around a certain aspect means your character's life is more dramatic or complicated, anyone can compel the aspect. You can even compel it on yourself---that's called a self-compel. Compels are the most common way for players to earn more [[fate point]]s.

There are two types of compels: [[Decision Compels]] and [[Event Compels]]

## Compelling Aspects

The other way you use aspects in the game is called a **compel**. If you're in a situation where having or being around a certain aspect means your character's life is more dramatic or complicated, someone can compel the aspect. That aspect can be on your character, the scene, location, game, or anywhere else that's currently in play. We'll start with character aspects, and then talk about [situation aspects](index.html "Compelling Situation Aspects") in a bit.

In order to compel an aspect, explain why the aspect is relevant, and then make an offer as to what the complication is. You can negotiate the terms of the complication a bit, until you reach a reasonable consensus. Whoever is getting compelled then has two options:

- Accept the complication and receive a [[fate point]]
- Pay a [[fate point]] to prevent the complication from happening

The complication from a compel occurs regardless of anyone's efforts---once you've made a deal and taken the [[fate point]], you can't use your skills or anything else to mitigate the situation. You have to deal with the new story developments that arise from the complication.

If you prevent the complication from happening, then you and the group describe how you avoid it. Sometimes it just means that you agree that the event never happened in the first place, and sometimes it means narrating your character doing something proactive. Whatever you need to do in order to make it make sense works fine, as long as the group is okay with it.

GMs, you're the final arbiter here, as always---not just on how the result of a compel plays out, but on whether or not a compel is valid in the first place. 
 Use the same judgment you apply to an invocation---it should make instinctive sense, or require only a small amount of explanation, that a complication might arise from the aspect.

Finally, and this is very important: **if a player wants to compel another character, it costs a [[fate point]] to propose the complication.** The GM can always compel for free, and any player can propose a compel on his or her own character for free.

### Clarification about Players Compelling Players

When you pay to propose a compel, the point you paid returns to the GM's infinite pool of [[fate point]]s. The proposed compel is then negotiated with the target of the compel. Once the compel is agreed, a [[fate point]] is paid from the infinite pool of [[fate point]]s to the target player. If the target player rejects the compel, their [[fate point]] is also paid to the infinite pool of [[fate point]]s.

If this were not the rule, you would be able to propose compels risk-free to drain other people's [[fate point]]s.

### For Veterans

In other Fate games, you might have seen player-driven compels referred to as "invoking for effect." It is clearer to just call it a compel, no matter who initiates it.

### Types of Compels

There are two major categories for what a compel looks like in the game: [[Event Compels]] and [[Decision Compels]]. These are tools to help you figure out what a compel should look like and help break any mental blocks.

### Retroactive Compels

Sometimes, you'll notice during the game that you've fulfilled the criteria for a compel without a [[fate point]] getting awarded. You've played your aspects to the hilt and gotten yourself into all kinds of trouble, or you've narrated crazy and dramatic stuff happening to a character related to their aspects just out of reflex.

Anyone who realizes this in play can mention it, and the [[fate point]] can be awarded retroactively, treating it like a compel after the fact. GMs, you're the final arbiter. It should be pretty obvious when something like this occurs, though---just look at the guidelines for event and decision compels above, and see if you can summarize what happened in the game according to those guidelines. If you can, award a [[fate point]].

### Compelling with Situation Aspects

Just like with every other kind of aspect use, you can use situation aspects (and by extension, game aspects) for compels. Because situation aspects are usually external to characters, you're almost always looking at event-based compels rather than decision-based ones. The character or characters affected get a [[fate point]] for the compel.
