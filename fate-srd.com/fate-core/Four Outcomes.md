[[Fate Core]]

# Four Outcomes

**When you roll the dice, either you're going to [[Fail]],[[tie]], [[Success|succeed]], or [[Success with Style|succeed with style]].**

Every roll you make in a Fate game results in one of four outcomes, generally speaking. The specifics may change a little depending on what kind of [[Four Actions|action you're taking]], but all the game actions fit this general pattern.

## Fail

**If you roll lower than your opposition, you [[fail]].**

This means one of several things: you don't get what you want, you get [[What To Do During Play#Succeed at a Cost|what you want at a serious cost]], or you suffer some negative mechanical consequence. Sometimes, it means more than one of those. It's the GM's job to determine an appropriate cost.

## Tie

**If you roll the same as your opposition, you [[tie]].**

This means either [[Success with Minor Cost| you get what you want, but at a minor cost]], or you get a lesser version of what you wanted.

## Succeed

**If you roll higher than your opposition by 1 or 2 [[shift]]s, you [[Success|succeed]].**

This means you get what you want at no cost.

## Succeed with Style

**If you roll higher than your opposition by 3 or more [[shift]]s, you [[Success with Style|succeed with style]].**

This means that you get what you want, but you also get an added benefit on top of that.

### For the GM: How Hard Should Skill Rolls Be?

For active opposition, you don't really need to worry about how hard the roll is---just use the NPC's skill level and roll the dice like the players do, letting the chips fall where they may. There are guidelines about NPC skill levels in [[Running the Game]].

For passive opposition, you have to decide what rank on the ladder the player has to beat. It's more an art than a science, but there are some guidelines to help you.

Anything that's two or more steps higher than the PC's skill level---Fair (+2) skill and Great (+4) opposition, for example--- means that the player will probably fail or need to invoke aspects to succeed.

Anything that's two or more steps lower than the PC's skill level---Fair (+2) skill and Mediocre (+0) opposition, for example---means that the player will probably not need to invoke aspects and have a good chance of succeeding with style.

Between that range, there's a roughly equal chance that they'll tie or succeed, and a roughly equal chance that they will or won't need to invoke aspects to do so.

Therefore, low difficulties are best when you want to give the PCs a chance to show off and be awesome, difficulties near their skill levels are best when you want to provide tension but not overwhelm them, and high difficulties are best when you want to emphasize how dire or unusual the circumstances are and make them pull out all the stops.

Finally, a couple of quick axioms:

Average is called Average for a reason---if nothing about the opposition sticks out, then the difficulty doesn't need more than a +1.

If you can think of at least one reason why the opposition sticks out, but otherwise just can't decide what the difficulty should be, pick Fair (+2). It's in the middle of a PC's range of skills, so it provides a decent challenge for every skill level except Great (+4), and you want to give PCs a chance to show off their peak skill anyway.
