[[Fate Core]]

# Taking Action, Dice, and The Ladder

Players, some of the things you'll do in a Fate game require you to [[Rolling the Dice|roll dice]] to see if your character [[Success|succeed]]s or not. You will always [[Rolling the Dice|roll the dice]] when you're opposing another character with your efforts, or when there's a significant obstacle in the way of your effort. Otherwise, just say what your character does and assume it happens.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]]To [[Create Advantage|create or unlock an advantage]] for your character, in the form of an [[aspect]] you can use

![[att_r.svg|30 ]]To [[attack]] someone in a [[conflict]]

![[def_r.svg|30]]To [[defend]] yourself in a [[conflict]]

[[Rolling the Dice]]



## Interpreting Results

When you [[Rolling the Dice|roll the dice]], you're trying to get a high enough roll to match or beat your opposition. That opposition is going to come in one of two forms: **active opposition**, from someone rolling dice against you, or **passive opposition**, from an obstacle that just has a set rating on [[the ladder]] for you to overcome. (GMs, you can also just decide your NPCs give passive opposition when you don't want to roll dice for them.)

Generally speaking, if you beat your opposition on [[the ladder]], you [[Success|succeed]] at your [[Action]]. A [[tie]] creates some effect, but not to the extent your character was intending. If you [[Success with Style|win by a lot]], something extra happens (like doing more harm to your opponent in a fight).

If you don't beat the opposition, either you don't succeed at your action, you succeed at a cost, or something else happens to complicate the [[Four Outcomes|outcome]]. Some game actions have special results when you fail at the roll.

When you beat a roll or a set obstacle, the difference between your opposition and your result is what is called [[shift]]s. When you roll equal to the opposition (a [[tie]]), you have zero [[shift]]s. Roll one over your opposition, and you have one [[shift]]. Two over means two [[shift]]s, and so on.

> Landon is trying to escape an ancient mechanical death trap he accidentally set off during a "routine" exploration of the Anthari Catacombs. Dozens of tiny (and some not-so-tiny) spears are shooting out of the walls in a certain hallway, and he needs to get past them to the other side.

> Amanda, the GM, says, "This is passive opposition, because it's just a trap in your way. It's opposing you at Great (+4). The Anthari really didn't want anyone getting to their temple treasure."

> Lenny sighs and says, "Well, I've got [[Athletics]] at Good (+3), so I'll try dodging and weaving through them to cross the hall."
>
> He takes up the dice and rolls, getting [-+++], for a result of +2. This steps up his result on [[the ladder]] by two, from Good (+3) to Superb (+5). That's enough to beat the opposition by one [[shift]] and succeed.
>
> Amanda says, "Well, it takes equal parts acrobatics and frantic stumbling, but you manage to make it through to the other side with only some cosmetic tears in your tunic to show for it. The mechanism shows no sign of stopping, though---you'll still have to deal with it on your way out."
>
> Lenny replies, "Just another day at the office," and Landon continues his trek through the catacombs.
