# Rolling the Dice

When you need to roll dice in Fate, pick up four Fate dice and roll them. When you read the dice, read every [+] as +1, every [0] as 0, and every [-] as --1. Add them all together. You'll get a result from --4 to +4, most often between --2 and +2.

Here are some sample dice totals:

```
[-+0+] = +1
[+-00] =
[+++-] = +2
[-000] = âˆ’1
```

The result on the dice isn't your final total, however. If your character has a skill that's appropriate to the action, you get to add your character's rating in that skill to whatever you rolled.

So, once you've rolled the dice, how do you determine what a particular result means? Glad you asked.

## The Math Behind the Dice

For folks who love stats, here are the odds for rolling certain results.
