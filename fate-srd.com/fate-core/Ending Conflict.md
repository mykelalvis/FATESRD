# Ending a Conflict

Under most circumstances, when all of the members of one side have either conceded the conflict or have been taken out, the conflict is over.

GMs, once you know a conflict has definitively ended, you can pass out all the [[fate point]]s earned from concession. Players, take the fate points for when your aspects were invoked against you, make a note of whatever consequences you suffered in the fight, and erase any checks in your stress boxes.

> After much struggle and insanity, the warehouse conflict is finally over. Amanda concedes the conflict on behalf of Og and his remaining thug, meaning that the PCs stay alive and can proceed to check out the smuggled goods they were interested in.
>
> Because it was a concession, Og gets away to fight another day. Because Lenny conceded to Amanda in an earlier example, Og also gets away with Landon's sword as a personal trophy.
>
> Because Lenny conceded, he gets [[fate point]]s. One for conceding, and another two for the mild and moderate consequences he took in the conflict. All the invocations used against him were free, so that's all he gets. Three [[fate point]]s.
>
> Ryan gets two [[fate point]]s, because Amanda let one of the thugs invoke his [Not the Face!] twice against him during the conflict.
>
> Lily gets no [[fate point]]s, because all the invocations against her were free, from advantages and boosts. Because she won, she doesn't get awarded for the consequences she took.

### Transitioning to a Contest or Challenge

You may find yourself in a conflict scene where the participants are no longer interested in or willing to harm one another, because of some change in the circumstances. If that happens, and there's still more to resolve, you can transition straight into a contest or challenge as you need. In that case, hold off on awarding the end-of-conflict [[fate point]]s and whatnot until you've also resolved the contest or challenge.

> In an earlier example, Cynere managed to get a vault door open so the three PCs could escape an endless horde of temple guardians. They all decide to run and try to lose them.
>
> Now, the guardians and the PCs have mutually opposing goals but can't harm one another, so now it's a contest. Instead of running the next exchange, Amanda just starts setting up for the chase.
>
> Even though the PCs have some consequences and are due some [[fate point]]s, they won't get them until after they get away, or if they get caught.
