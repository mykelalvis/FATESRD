[[Fate Core]]

# Advancement & Change

Your characters aren't going to remain static through the entire campaign. As their stories play out, they'll have the chance to grow and change in response to the events that happen in play. The conflicts they face and the complications they overcome will alter your sense of who they are and push them toward new challenges.

In addition to your characters, the game world will change also. You'll resolve threats as you play, or change the face of a location, or make such an impact on the world that one of the issues may need to change.

Character advancement in Fate comes in one of two flavors: either you can change something on your sheet to something else that's equivalent, or you can add new things to your sheet. The opportunities you get to do this are collectively called _milestones_.

## Defining Milestones

A milestone is a moment during the game where you have the chance to change or advance your character. They are called milestones because they usually happen at significant "break points" in the action of a game---[[Scenes, Sessions, and Scenarios|the end of a session, the end of a scenario, and the end of a story arc]], respectively.

Usually, those break points immediately follow some significant event in the story that justifies your character changing in response to events. You might reveal a significant plot detail or have a cliffhanger at the end of a session. You might defeat a major villain or resolve a plotline at the end of a scenario. You might resolve a major storyline that shakes up the campaign world at the end of an arc.

Obviously, things won't always line up that nicely, so GMs, you have some discretion in deciding when a certain level of milestone occurs. If it seems satisfying to give out a milestone in the middle of a session, go ahead, but stick to the guidelines here to keep from handing out too many advancement opportunities too often.

**Do all PCs get Milestones at the same time?** [Unofficial consensus](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/114148/do-all-pcs-get-milestones-at-the-same-time) is that a milestone is gained at the end of a narrative arc, but the end of a narrative arc for one character need not be the end of the arc for another. So if you want to, you can advance characters per personal arcs or as a group.  

Milestones come in three levels of importance:
- [[Minor Milestone]]
- [[Significant Milestone]]
- [[Major Milestone]]
