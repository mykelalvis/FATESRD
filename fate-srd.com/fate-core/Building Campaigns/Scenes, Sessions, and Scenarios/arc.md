An **arc** is a series of sessions that often contain plot elements that carry over from session to session. Those plot elements don't have to conclude within an arc, but there are usually significant developments and changes that come about over the course of it. Think of this as similar to a third- or half-season of a television show. It's likely comprised of about four sessions of play.
