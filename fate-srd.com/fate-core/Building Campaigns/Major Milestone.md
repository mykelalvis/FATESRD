## Major Milestone

A major milestone should only occur when something happens in the campaign that shakes it up a lot---the end of a story arc (or around three scenarios), the death of a main NPC villain, or any other large-scale change that reverberates around your game world.

These milestones are about gaining more power. The challenges of yesterday simply aren't sufficient to threaten these characters anymore, and the threats of tomorrow will need to be more adept, organized, and determined to stand against them in the future.

Achieving a major milestone confers the benefits of a significant milestone and a minor milestone, and all of the following additional options:

- If you have an extreme consequence, rename it to reflect that you've moved past its most debilitating effects. This allows you to take another extreme consequence in the future, if you desire.
- Take an additional point of refresh, which allows you to immediately buy a new stunt or keep it in order to give yourself more [[fate point]]s at the beginning of a session.
- Advance a skill beyond the campaign's current skill cap, if you're able to, thus increasing the skill cap.
- Rename your character's high concept if you desire.

Reaching a major milestone is a pretty big deal. Characters with more stunts are going to have a diverse range of bonuses, making their skills much more effective by default. Characters with higher refresh will have a much larger fountain of [[fate point]]s to work with when sessions begin, which means they'll be less reliant on compels for a while.

GMs, when the player characters go past the skill cap, it will necessarily change the way [you make opposition NPCs](../creating-and-playing-opposition/index.html "Creating the Opposition"), because you're going to need foes who can match the PCs in terms of base competence so as to provide a worthy challenge. It won't happen all at once, which will give you the chance to introduce more powerful enemies gradually, but if you play long enough, eventually you're going to have PCs who have Epic and Legendary skill ratings---that alone should give you a sense of what kind of villains you'll need to bring to get in their way.

Most of all, a major milestone should signal that lots of things in the world of your game have changed. Some of that will probably be reflected in world advancement, but given the number of chances the PCs have had to revise their aspects in response to the story, you could be looking at a group with a much different set of priorities and concerns than they had when they started.

> Cynere reaches the end of a long story arc and is awarded a major milestone. In the game, the PCs have just accomplished the overthrow of Barathar, Smuggler Queen of the Sindral Reach, which leaves an enormous power vacuum in the game world.
>
> Lily looks at her character sheet. She took an extreme consequence in the past arc of scenarios, and allowed one of her aspects to get replaced with the aspect [Soul-Burned by the Demon Arc'yeth]. She now has the opportunity to rename that aspect again, and she decides to call it [I Must Kill Arc'yeth's Kind]---she hasn't quite escaped the scars of the experience, but it's better than where she was, given that her aims are now proactive.
>
> She also gets an additional point of refresh. She asks Amanda whether or not she can turn her experience with Arc'yeth into something that will allow her to fight demons in the future. Amanda sees no reason to object, and Lily decides to buy a stunt on the spot.
>
> "Demon-Slayer: +2 to the use of the Warmaster stunt, when she chooses to use it against any demon or any demonic servitor."
>
> Lily records the new stunt on Cynere's character sheet, and rewrites the appropriate aspect.
>
> Zird the Arcane also gets a major milestone. Ryan looks over his character sheet, and realizes that he's in a position to advance his peak skill, [[Lore]], to Superb (+5). He does so, and Amanda makes a note that she needs to make any wizardly enemies Zird might encounter that much more powerful, just to get his attention.
>
> Finally, Landon also reaches a major milestone. Recently in the plot, Landon discovered that the Ivory Shroud was much more than a martial arts society---they've been secret political movers and shakers for a long time, and recently supported Barathar in her efforts to control the Reach.
>
> In response to this, Lenny decides to alter his high concept slightly to `Former Ivory Shroud Disciple`, indicating his desire to distance himself from the order. Amanda tells him that the Shroud isn't going to take his defection well.
>
> So we have Cynere with a new appetite for killing demons, Zird reaching a heretofore unseen level of power, and Landon questioning his loyalty to his only real source of discipline. Amanda makes a lot of notes about what this means for the next few scenarios.

### Back to Character Creation

One way of looking at a major milestone is that it's the equivalent of a season finale in a television show. Once you start the next session, a lot of things have the potential to be fundamentally different about your game---you might be focused on new problems, several characters will have aspects changed, there will be new threats in the setting, and so on.

When that happens, you might decide that it's a worthwhile endeavor to take a session to sit down like you did at character creation and review all the PCs again, altering or adjusting anything that seems like it might need revision---new skill configurations, a new set of stunts, more changes to aspects, etc. You may also want to examine the issues in your game and make sure they're still appropriate, revise location aspects, or anything else that seems necessary to move your game forward.

So long as you keep them at the same level of refresh and skill points they had, reconvening like this might be exactly what you need to make sure everyone's still on the same page about the game. And GMs, remember---the more you give the players a chance to actively invest in the game world, the more it'll pay off for you when you're running the game.
