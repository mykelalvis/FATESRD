# Resolving Attacks

A successful [[attack]] lands a hit equivalent to its [[shift]] value on a target. So if you get three [[shift]]s on an attack, you land a 3-[[shift]] hit.

If you get hit by an [[attack]], one of two things happen: either you absorb the hit and stay in the fight, or you're [[taken out]].

Fortunately, you have two options for absorbing hits to stay in the fight---you can take [[stress]] and/or [[consequences]]. You can also [[concede]] a conflict before you're [[taken out]], in order to preserve some control over what happens to your character.  If, for whatever reason, you want to forego your defense and take a hit (like, say, to interpose yourself in the path of an arrow that's about to skewer your friend), you can.

Because you're not defending, the attacker's rolling against Mediocre (+0) opposition, which means you're probably going to take a bad hit.
