# Fail

**If you roll lower than your opposition, you fail.**

This means one of several things: you don't get what you want, you can get [[Success with Serious Cost#Success at a Serious Cost|Success at a Serious Cost]], or you suffer some negative mechanical consequence. Sometimes, it means more than one of those. It's the GM's job to determine an appropriate cost.
