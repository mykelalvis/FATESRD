## Minor Cost

A minor cost should add a story detail that's problematic or bad for the PC, but doesn't necessarily endanger progress. You could also ask the PC to take [[Stress]] or give someone who opposes the PCs a [[boost]].

It's okay if the minor cost is mainly a narrative detail, showing how the PC just barely scratched by. See more advice about dealing with costs on in [[Running the Game]].
