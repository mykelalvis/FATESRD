[[Action|Four Actions]]

# Defend

**Use the defend action to avoid an attack or prevent someone from creating an advantage against you.**

Whenever someone [[attack]]s you in a [[conflict]] or tries to [[Create Advantage]] on you, you always get a chance to defend. As with [[attacks]], this isn't always about avoiding physical sources of danger---some of the skills allow you to defend against attempts to harm your mind or damage your resolve.

Because you roll to defend as a reaction, your opposition is almost always active. If you're rolling a defend action against passive opposition, it's because the environment is hostile to you somehow (like a blazing fire), or the attacking NPC isn't important enough for the GM to bother with dice.

- **When you fail at a defense**, you suffer the consequences of whatever you were trying to prevent. You might take a hit or have an advantage created on you.
- **When you [[tie]] a defense**, you grant your opponent a [[boost]]
- **When you [[Success|succeed]] at a defense**, you successfully avoid the attack or the attempt to gain an advantage on you.
- **When you [[Success with Style|succeed with style]] at a defense**, it works like a normal success, but you also gain a boost as you turn the tables momentarily.

## Can I Defend Against Overcome Actions?

Technically, no. The defend action is there to stop you from taking [[Stress]], [[consequences]], or [[situation aspects]]---basically, to protect you against all the bad stuff represented with mechanics.

But! You can roll active opposition if you're in the way of any [[action]], as per the [[Four Outcomes|guidelines]]. So if someone's doing an [[overcome]] action that might fail because you're in the way, you should speak up and say, "Hey, I'm in the way!" and roll to oppose it. You don't get any extra benefits like the defend action gives you, but you also don't have to worry about the aforementioned bad stuff if you lose.

## No Stacked Effects!

You'll notice that the defend action has outcomes that mirror some of the outcomes in attack and create an advantage. For example, it says that when you [[tie]] a defense, you grant your opponent a [[boost]]. Under attack, it says that when you [[tie]], you receive a [[boost]].

That doesn't mean the attacker gets two [[boost]]s---it's the same result, just from two different points of view. It was written that way so that the results were consistent when you looked up the rule, regardless of what action you took.

> [!info]- Example
> Zird the Arcane is arguing a magical thesis before the council of the Collegia Arcana. But one of the adjutants on the council, an old rival named Vokus Skortch, has it in for Zird. He wants not only to see Zird fail, but to damage Zird's self-confidence by forcing him to misstep and doubt himself. The group agrees that they know each other well enough that Skortch could affect him this way, so the conflict is on.
>
> As Zird finishes his opening argument, Amanda describes how Skortch uses [[Provoke]] as an attack, poking holes in Zird's theories and forcing him to reevaluate. Skortch has a [[Provoke]] of Good (+3).
>
> Zird defends with [[Will]], which he has at Fair (+2).
> Amanda rolls for Skortch and gets a +1, for a total of Great (+4).
> Ryan rolls for Zird and gets a +2, [[Tie|tying]] at Great (+4).
>
> Zird doesn't have to deal with taking a hit, but he does grant Skortch a [[boost]], which Amanda decides to call `Momentarily Tripped Up`.
