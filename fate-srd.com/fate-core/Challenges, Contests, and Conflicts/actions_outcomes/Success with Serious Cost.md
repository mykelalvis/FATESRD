# Success at a Serious Cost

**A [[Serious Cost]] does more than complicate the PC's life or promise something worse to come**---it takes a serious and possibly irrevocable toll, right now.

One way you can do this is by taking a [[Minor Cost]] to the next level. Instead of suspecting that a guard heard them open the vault, a few guards burst in the room, weapons drawn. Instead of being merely cut off from their allies by a collapsing ceiling, one or more of those allies ends up buried in the debris. Instead of merely having to face an awkward situation with Berthold, he's still angry and out for their blood.

Other options could include:

- Reinforce the opposition. You might clear one of an NPC's stress boxes, improve one of their skills by one step for the scene, or give them a new [[aspect]] with a [[free invocation]].
- Bring in new opposition or a new obstacle, such as additional enemies or a [[situation aspect]] that worsens the situation.
- Delay success. The task at hand will take much longer than expected.
- Give the PC a [[consequences|consequence]] that follows logically from the circumstances---mild if they have one available, moderate if they don't.

If you're stuck for just how serious a serious cost should be, you may want to use the margin of failure as a gauge. For instance, in the vault-opening example, above---the one where the guards hear the PC and burst in the room---if the player failed their [[Burglary]] roll by 1 or 2, the PCs outnumber the guards. Not a tough fight, but a fight nonetheless. If they failed it by 3 to 5, it's an even match, one that's likely to use up resources like [[fate point]]s or [[consequences]]. But if they failed by 6 or more, they're outnumbered and in real danger.
