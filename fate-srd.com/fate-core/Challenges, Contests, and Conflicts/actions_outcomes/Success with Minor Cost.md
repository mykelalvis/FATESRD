# Success with Minor Cost

This is like [[Success]], but there is a [[Minor Cost]] incurred by the character.

# Succeed at a Cost

You can also offer to give the PCs what they want, but at a price---in this case, the failed roll means they weren't able to achieve their goals without consequence.

**A minor cost should complicate the PC's life.** Like the above suggestion, this focuses on using failure as a means to change up the situation a bit, rather than just negating whatever the PC wanted. Some suggestions:

- Foreshadow some imminent peril. _"The lock opens with a soft click, but the same can't be said for the vault door. If they didn't know you were here before, they sure do now."_
- Introduce a new wrinkle. _"Yes, the Guildmaster is able to put you  in touch with a mage who can translate the withered tome---a guy named Berthold. You know him, actually, but the last time you saw him was years ago, when he caught you with his wife."_
- Present the player with a tough choice. _"You brace the collapsing ceiling long enough for two of the others to get through safely, but not the rest. Who's it going to be?"_
- Place an aspect on the PC or the scene. _"Somehow you manage to land on your feet, but with a_ [Twisted Ankle] _as a souvenir."_
- Give an NPC a boost. _"Nikolai surprises you a bit by agreeing to your offer, but he does so with a wry smile that makes you uneasy. Clearly, Nikolai Has A Plan."_
- Check one of the PC's stress boxes. Careful with this one---it's only a real cost if the PC's likely to take more hits in the same scene. If you don't think that's going to happen, go with another choice.
