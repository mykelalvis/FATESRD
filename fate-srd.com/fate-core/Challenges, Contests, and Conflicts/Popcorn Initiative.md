# Popcorn Initiative

This is a distillation of [[Elective Action Order]], which is the full version of this initiative type (go read it!).

## Everyone gets a turn

Everyone gets a turn for every [[Exchange]].  Entities who don't get a turn (for whatever reason)...don't get a turn.

## Who goes first?

Unless it is obvious who acts first (surprise, held actions before [[exchanges]]s, [[Super Speed]], already-in-motion, etc.), then the highest [[Notice]] or [[Empathy]] goes first per the existing [[Turn Order]] rule in [[Fate Core]].  _This is the only time that matters._

## The Exchange Cycle

On a given [[Exchange]], the following replaces the regular [[Turn Order]] from [[Fate Core]].

1. Everyone is [probably] "initially available" to act, and so they get an "Available" card.  On the other side is "Acted".
2. The first person to act (per [[#Who goes first?]]) acts.
3. That person then picks the next person to act.
4. Once everyone has acted, the last person to act picks the person to start the next [[Exchange]].
5. Repeat until the [[conflict]] has resolved.

As noted in [[Elective Action Order]], it is not always best to pick all your side in order.  One of the more effective means of managing a fight is to make it so that all the other side has to go before the end of the exchange and everyone on your side can [[Create Advantage]] or other setups.
