# Turn Order

Your turn order in a conflict is based on your skills. In a physical conflict, compare your [[Notice]] skill to the other participants. In a mental conflict, compare your [[Empathy]] skill. Whoever has the highest gets to go first, and then everyone else in descending order.

If there's a tie, compare a secondary or tertiary skill. For physical conflicts, that's [[Athletics]], then [[Physique]]. For mental conflicts, [[Rapport]], then [[Will]].

GMs, for a simple option, pick your most advantageous NPC to determine your place in the turn order, and let all your NPCs go at that time.

> Cynere has a [[Notice]] of Good (+3), higher than everyone else, so she goes first.
>
> Zird has a [[Notice]] of Average (+1), so he goes second.
>
> Landon and Og both lack the [[Notice]] skill. Landon has [[Athletics]] at Good (+3), and Og has it at Fair (+2), so Landon goes third and Og goes last.
