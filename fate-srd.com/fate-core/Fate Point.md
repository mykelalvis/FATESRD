[[Fate Core]]

# Fate Points

A Fate Point is the currency of awesomeness in Fate.  It is the thing that powers your [[stunt]]s and [[aspect]]s, and allows you to move dramatically through the game.

You use tokens to represent how many [[fate point]]s you have at any given time during play. [[Fate Point]]s are one of your most important resources in Fate---they're a measure of how much influence you have to make the story go in your character's favor.

You can spend [[fate point]]s to **[[invoke]]** an [[aspect]], to declare a story detail, or to activate certain powerful stunts.

You earn [[fate point]]s by accepting a **[[compel]]** on one of your aspects.

A word of warning: don't use edible things as tokens, especially if the food hasn't arrived yet

## Fate Points

You can use anything as Fate Points---beads, pennies, or poker chips---but if you want your Fate Points to match your dice, check out the [official Fate Points](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-points/) from Evil Hat Productions.
