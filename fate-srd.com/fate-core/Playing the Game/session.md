# Session

The sum total of all the [[scene]]s you run through in a single sitting. A session ends when you and your friends pack it up for the night and go home. For most people, a session is about 2 to 4 hours, but there is no theoretical limit---if you have few obligations, then you're only really limited by the need for food and sleep. A minor milestone usually occurs after a session.
