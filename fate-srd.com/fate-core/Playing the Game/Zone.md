# Zones

GMs, if your conflict takes place over a large area, you may want to break it down into zones for easier reference.

A zone is an abstract representation of physical space. The best definition of a zone is that it's close enough that you can interact directly with someone (in other words, walk up to and punch them in the face).

Generally speaking, a conflict should rarely involve more than a handful of zones. Two to four is probably sufficient, save for really big conflicts. This isn't a miniatures board game---zones should give a tactile sense of the environment, but at the point where you need something more than a cocktail napkin to lay it out, you're getting too complicated.

- If you can describe the area as bigger than a house, you can probably divide it into two or more zones---think of a cathedral or a shopping center parking lot.
- If it's separated by stairs, a ladder, a fence, or a wall, it could be divided zones, like two floors of a house.
- "Above X" and "below X" can be different zones, especially if moving between them takes some doing---think of the airspace around something large, like a blimp.

When you're setting up your zones, note any situation aspects that could make moving between those zones problematic. They'll be important later, when people want to move from zone to zone. If that means you need more situation aspects, add them now.

> [!info]- Example
> Amanda decides the warehouse needs to be multiple zones. The main floor is big enough, in her mind, for two zones, and the `Heavy Crates` she mentioned earlier make it hard to freely move between them.
>
> She knows there's also a second floor ringing the inner walls, so she makes that an additional zone. She adds `Ladder Access Only` to the scene.
>
> If, for some reason, someone decides to run outside, she figures that can be a fourth zone, but she doesn't think she needs any aspects for it.
>
> She sketches the rough map on an index card for everyone to see.

> In a mental conflict, it might not always make sense to use [[situation aspect]]s and [[zone]]s to describe a physical space. It'd make sense in an interrogation, for example, where the physical features of the space create fear, but not in a really violent argument with a loved one. Also, when people are trying to hurt each other emotionally, usually they're using their target's own weaknesses against them---in other words, their own aspects.
