# Setting the Scene

GMs and players, you should talk briefly before you start a conflict about the circumstances of the scene. This mainly involves coming up with quick answers to variations of the four W-questions, such as:

- Who's in the conflict?
- Where are they positioned relative to one another?
- When is the conflict taking place? Is that important?
- What's the environment like?  Is it divided into different [[zone]]s?

You don't need an exhaustive amount of detail here, like precise measures of distance or anything like that. Just resolve enough to make it clear for everyone what's going on.

GMs, you're going to take this information and create situation aspects to help further define the arena of conflict.

> [!info]- Example
> Landon, Zird, and Cynere are breaking into a dockside warehouse in order to find smuggled goods on behalf of their latest employer. Unfortunately, someone tipped the smuggler off. Now Og, one of his thug lieutenants, is at the warehouse waiting for them to show up, and he brought along four friends.
>
> The participants in the conflict are pretty obvious---the PCs, plus Og and four nameless enforcers, all NPCs under Amanda's control. The warehouse is the environment, and the group takes a moment to talk about it---boxes and crates everywhere, large and open, there's probably a second floor, and Amanda mentions the loading door is open because they're waiting for a ship to come in.

### Situation Aspects

GMs, when you're setting the scene, keep an eye out for fun-sounding features of the environment to make intoÂ [[situation aspect]]s, especially if you think someone might be able to take advantage of them in an interesting way in a conflict. Don't overload it---find three to five evocative things about your conflict location and make them into aspects.

Good options for situation aspects include:

- Anything regarding the general mood, weather, or lighting---dark or badly lit, storming, creepy, crumbling, blindingly bright, etc.
- Anything that might affect or restrict movement---filthy, mud everywhere, slippery, rough, etc.
- Things to hide behind---vehicles, obstructions, large furniture, etc.
- Things you can knock over, wreck, or use as improvised weapons---bookshelves, statues, etc.
- Things that are flammable
 

> [!info]+ Situation Aspects & Zones In Mental Conflicts
> 
> In a mental conflict, it might not always make sense to use [[situation aspect]]s and [[zone]]s to describe a physical space. It'd make sense in an interrogation, for example, where the physical features of the space create fear, but not in a really violent argument with a loved one. Also, when people are trying to hurt each other emotionally, usually they're using their target's own weaknesses against them---in other words, their own aspects.
> 
> So, you may not even need situation aspects or zones for a lot of mental conflicts. Don't feel obligated to include them.
> [!info]- Example
> Considering our warehouse again, Amanda thinks about what might make good situation aspects.
>
> She decides that there are enough crates in here to make free movement a potential problem, so she picks `Heavy Crates` and `Cramped` as aspects. The loading door is open, which means that there's a large dock with water in it, so she also picks `Open to the Water` as a [[situation aspect]], figuring that someone might try to knock someone in.

As the scene unfolds, players might suggest features of the environment that are perfect as aspects. If the GM described the scene as being poorly lit, a player should be able to invoke the `Shadows` to help on a [[Stealth]] roll even if she hadn't previously established it as an aspect.  If the feature would require some intervention on the part of the characters in the scene to become aspect-worthy, then that's the purview of the [[create advantage]] action. Usually the barn doesn't catch `On Fire!` without someone kicking over the lantern. Usually.
