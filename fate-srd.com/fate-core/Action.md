# Four Actions

When you make a skill roll, you're taking one of four actions: 
- [[overcome]]
- [[create advantage]]
- [[attack]]
- [[defend]]

There are four types of actions you can take in a game of Fate. When you make a skill roll, you have to decide which of these you're going to try. The [[Default Fate Core Skill List|skill descriptions]] tell you which actions are appropriate for that skill and under which circumstances. Usually, the action you need to take will be pretty obvious from the skill description, your intent, and the situation in play, but sometimes you might have to talk it over with the group to find out which is the most appropriate.
