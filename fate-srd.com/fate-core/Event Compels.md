## Event compels

Other times a [[compel]] reflects something happening that makes life more complicated for you. If you have `Strange Luck`, of course that spell you're working on in class accidentally turns the dour Potions Master's hair orange. If you `Owe Don Valdeon a Favor`, then Don Valdeon shows up and demands that you perform a service for him just when it's least convenient.

In any case, when an [[aspect]] is [[compel]]led against you, the person compelling it offers you a [[fate point]] and suggests that the [[aspect]] has a certain effect---that you'll make a certain decision or that a particular event will occur. You can discuss it back and forth, proposing tweaks or changes to the suggested compel. After a moment or two, you need to decide whether to accept the compel. If you agree, you take the [[fate point]] and your character makes the suggested decision or the event happens. If you refuse, you must pay a [[fate point]] from your own supply. Yes, this means that if you don't have any [[fate point]]s, you can't refuse a compel!

An event-based compel happens to the character in spite of herself, when the world around her responds to a certain aspect in a certain way and creates a complicating circumstance. It looks like this:

- You have ____ aspect and are in ____ situation, so it makes sense that, unfortunately, ____ would happen to you. Damn your luck.

> Cynere has `Infamous Girl with Sword` while covertly attending a gladiatorial contest, so it makes sense that, unfortunately, an admirer would recognize her in the stands and make a huge fuss, turning all eyes in the arena her way. Damn her luck.
>
> Landon has `I Owe Old Finn Everything` and is returning to his home village after hearing it was sacked by barbarians, so it makes sense that, unfortunately, Old Finn was captured and taken far into the mountains with their war party. Damn his luck.
>
> Zird has `Rivals in the Collegia Arcana` and is attempting to get an audience with their Inner Council, so it makes sense that, unfortunately, his rivals force the Collegia to demand he provide a detailed account of his highly-coveted research to re-establish his relationship with the organization. Damn his luck.

As you'll see with decision-based compels, the real mileage is in the complication itself. Without that, you don't really have anything worth focusing on---the fact that the PCs continually have complicated and dramatic things happen to them is, well, exactly what makes them PCs in the first place.

GMs, event-based compels are your opportunity to party. You're expected to control the world around the PCs, so having that world react to them
in an unexpected way is pretty much part and parcel of your job description.

Players, event-based compels are great for you. You get rewarded simply by being there---how much more awesome can you get? You might have a difficult time justifying an event-based compel yourself, as it requires you to assert control over an element of the game that you typically aren't in charge of. Feel free to propose an event-based compel, but remember that the GM has the final say on controlling the game world and
may veto you if she's got something else in mind.
