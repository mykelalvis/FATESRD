# Stunts

A stunt is a special trait your character has that changes the way a skill works for you. Stunts indicate some special, privileged way a character uses a skill that is unique to whoever has that stunt, which is a pretty common trope in a lot of settings---special or elite training, exceptional talents, the mark of destiny, genetic alteration, innate coolness, and a myriad of other reasons all explain why some people get more out of their skills than others do.

Unlike skills, which are about the sort of things anyone can do in your campaign, stunts are about individual characters. For that reason, the next several pages are about how to make your own stunts, but we'll also have example stunts listed under each skill in the [[Default Fate Core Skill List]].

Having stunts in your game allows you to differentiate characters that have the same skills as one another.

> [!info]- Example
> Landon and Cynere both have a high [[Fight]] skill, but Cynere also has the `Warmaster` stunt, which makes her better at creating advantages with the skill. This differentiates the two characters a great deal---Cynere has a unique capability to analyze and understand her enemies' weaknesses in a way Landon doesn't.
>
> One might imagine Cynere starting a fight by testing an enemy with moves and jabs, carefully assessing her opponent's limits before moving in for a decisive strike, whereas Landon is happy to wade in and chop away.

You can also use this to set apart a certain set of abilities as belonging to a dedicated few, if that's something your setting needs. For example, in a contemporary setting, you might feel that there shouldn't be a base skill that allows just anyone to have medical training. (Unless, of course, it's a game about doctors.) However, as a stunt for another, more general knowledge skill (like [[Lore]]), you can have one character be "the doctor" if that's what the player wants. 

## Stunts and Refresh

Taking a new stunt beyond the first three reduces your character's refresh rate by one.
