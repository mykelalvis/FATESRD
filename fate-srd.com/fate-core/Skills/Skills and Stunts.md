# Skills & Stunts

## Defining Skills

A **skill** is a word that describes a broad family of competency at something---such as [[Athletics], [[Fight]], or [[Deceive]]---which your character might have gained through innate talent, training, or years of trial and error. Skills are the basis for everything your character actually does in the game that involves challenge and chance (and dice).

Skills are rated on the adjective [[the ladder|ladder]]. The higher the rating, the better your character is at the skill. Taken together, your list of skills gives you a picture of that character's potential for action at a glance---what you're best at, what you're okay at, and what you're not so good at.

We define skills in two ways in Fate---in terms of the _game actions_ that you can do with them, and the _context_ in which you can use them. There are only a handful of basic game actions, but the number of potential contexts is infinite.

## The Basic Game Actions

We cover these in more detail in [[Actions and Outcomes]], but here's a quick reference so that you don't have to flip all the way over there right now.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: True to its name, you tackle some kind of challenge, engaging task, or hindrance related to your skill.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Whether you're discovering something that already exists about an opponent or creating a situation that helps you succeed, creating advantages allows you to discover and create aspects, and lets you get free invocations of them.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: You try to harm someone in a conflict. That harm may be physical, mental, emotional, or social in nature.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: You try to keep someone from harming you, getting past you, or creating an advantage to use against you.

There are also some special effects that some skills perform, such as giving you additional [[Stress]] boxes for a conflict. See [[Physique]] and [[Will]] in the default skill list below for examples.

Even though there are only four actions that all skills adhere to, the skill in question lends context to the action. For example, both [[Burglary]] and [[Crafts]] allow you to create an advantage, but only under very different contexts---[[Burglary]] allows you to do it when you're casing a place you're about to break into, and [[Crafts]] allows you to do it when you're examining a piece of machinery. The different skills let you differentiate the PCs' abilities from one another a bit, allowing each person to have a unique contribution to the game.

## Defining Stunts

A [[stunt]] is a special trait your character has that changes the way a skill works for you.
