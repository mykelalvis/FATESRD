[[Fate Core]]

# Teamwork

Characters can help each other out on actions. There are two versions of helping in Fate---combining skills, for when you are all putting the same kind of effort into an action (like using [[Physique]] together to push over a crumbling wall), and stacking advantages, for when the group is setting a single person up to do well (like causing multiple distractions so one person can use [[Stealth]] to get into a fortress).

When you combine skills, figure out who has the highest skill level among the participants. Each other participant who has at least an Average (+1) in the same skill adds a +1 to the highest person's skill level, and then only the lead character rolls. So if you have three helpers and you're the highest, you roll your skill level with a +3 bonus.

If you fail a roll to combine skills, all of the participants share in the potential costs---whatever complication affects one character affects all of them, or everyone has to take consequences. Alternatively, you can impose a cost that affects all the characters the same.

> [!info]- Example
> Continuing with our temple chase example, because it's group vs. group, everyone decides it'd be easier to just combine skills.
>
> Of the three PCs, Cynere has the highest [[Athletics]], at Great (+4). Landon has Good (+3) [[Athletics]] and Zird has Average (+1) [[Athletics]], so they each contribute +1. Cynere rolls the contest on behalf of the PCs at Fantastic (+6).
>
> Amanda's temple guardians only have Average (+1) [[Athletics]], but there are five of them, so they roll Superb (+5) for the purposes of the contest.

When you stack advantages, each person takes a [[Create Advantage]] action as usual, and gives whatever free invocations they get to a single character. Remember that multiple free invocations from the same aspect can stack.

> [!info]- Example
> Zird and Cynere want to set Landon up for an extremely big hit on Tremendor, the much-feared giant of the Northern Wastes.
>
> Both Cynere and Zird roll to [[Create Advantage]] on their turns, resulting in three free invocations on a [Flashy Distraction] they make from Zird's magical fireworks (which succeeded to create the advantage) and Cynere's glancing hits (which succeeded with style to add two more free invocations).
>
> They pass those to Landon, and on his turn, he uses them all for a gigantic +6 to his attack.[]

### Revising Teamwork in Fate

"Some people are critical of the teamwork rules in Fate; depending on the day of the week, I'm one of them", says [[Ryan Macklin]], one of the authors of Fate. In his article [Revising Teamwork in Fate](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002001443/http://ryanmacklin.com/2015/08/revising-teamwork-in-fate/) he offers up some seasoned thinking on Teamwork Rules.
