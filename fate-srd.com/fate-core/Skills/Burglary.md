# Burglary

The Burglary skill covers your character's aptitude for stealing things and getting into places that are off-limits.

In genres that rely on the use of a lot of technology, this skill also includes a proficiency in the related tech, allowing the character to hack security systems, disable alarm systems, and whatnot.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: As stated above, Burglary allows you to overcome any obstacle related to theft or infiltration. Bypassing locks and traps, pickpocketing and filching, covering your tracks, and other such activities all fall under the purview of this skill.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: You can case a location with Burglary, to determine how hard it will be to break into and what kind of security you're dealing with, as well as discover any vulnerabilities you might exploit. You can also examine the work of other burglars to determine how a particular heist was done, and create or discover aspects related to whatever evidence they may have left behind.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Burglary isn't used for attacks.

![[def_r.svg|30]][[Defend]]: Same here. It's not really a conflict skill, so there's not a lot of opportunity to use it to defend

## Burglary Stunts

- **Always a Way Out**. +2 on Burglary rolls made to [[Create Advantage]] whenever you're trying to escape from a location.
- **Security Specialist**. You don't have to be present to provide active opposition to someone trying to overcome security measures you put in place or worked on. (Normally, a character would roll against passive opposition for that.)
- **Talk the Talk**. You can use Burglary in place of [[Contacts]] whenever you're dealing specifically with other thieves and burglars.
