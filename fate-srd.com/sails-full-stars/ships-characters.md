# Ships as Characters

Ships have aspects, skills, and stunts, just like regular characters. If
the players start the game in command of---or serving aboard---their own
ship, take some time to discuss the ship's origins and history so you
can decide what statistics to assign it.

Ships come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. A ship with no
stunts is considered small, which means that it carries 20 guns and 100
crew, and up to 300 tons of cargo. To increase a ship's size, take the
Medium Ship and Large Ship stunts. For every step in size difference
between two ships, the larger ship receives +1 to attack and defend
against the smaller ship in combat.

## Ship Aspects

Every ship has a _high concept_ and a _crew aspect_. The high concept is
a brief description of the ship as a whole, such as [Poorly Repaired
Merchantman] or [Intimidating French Warship]. The
crew aspect describes the makeup and personality of the crew, such as
[Merciless Pirate Scum] or [Patriotic but
Inexperienced].

A vessel controlled by the players starts with 3 additional aspects, for
a total of 5. Important NPC vessels may also have additional aspects in
proportion to the significance of the vessel to the story.

## Ship Skills

Skills associated with a ship represent the proficiencies of its crew.
Choose these skills _only_ from the following list:

- [[Athletics]]
- Craft
- [[Fight]]
- [[Notice]]
- [[Provoke]]
- Sail
- [[Shoot]]
- [[Stealth]]
- [[Will]]

For an NPC vessel, use the guidelines in [[Fate Core]] (page 214) for
giving skills to nameless NPCs. Don't use the guidelines for supporting
and main NPCs; only use those guidelines when making important non-ship
NPCs.

For the starting PC ship, give it the skill levels for an Average, Fair,
or Good nameless NPC, depending on what makes sense for your story.

When the ship's crew performs a task, use the crew's skill rank.
However, if a character takes direct command of the crew while they're
performing the task, use the character's skill rank instead. In this
case, the character must participate in the task alongside the crew, and
the character cannot contribute to any other tasks simultaneously. Only
one character can take command of a given task at once, and other
characters cannot provide teamwork bonuses.

## Ship Stunts

Stunts represent special equipment aboard ship or innate features of the
ship itself. A ship controlled by the players gets 1 free stunt. Ships
do not have [[fate point]]s or refresh.

**Medium Ship:** This is a frigate-sized ship, carrying 40 guns, with a
capacity of 250 crew members and 750 tons of cargo.

**Large Ship:** This is a ship of the line, carrying 80 guns, with a
capacity of 600 crew members and 1800 tons of cargo. This ship is also
large enough to carry two phlogiston-jet cutter boats. To purchase this
stunt, the ship must already have the Medium Ship stunt.

**Fine Sails:** High-quality materials provide better resistance to the
winds, which produces higher maximum speed. The ship's navigator gains
+2 to Sail when determining travel times or racing other vessels.

**Maneuverable:** The mechanisms operating the ship's sails have been
improved. The crew gains +2 to Sail rolls to gain or remove positional
aspects during combat.

**Long Guns:** Lengthened barrels and expanded prometheum chambers
extend the range of the ship's guns. As long as the ship can maintain an
[At Long Range] aspect between itself and its opponent, it
gains an ongoing +2 to defend against attacks from that opponent. The
[At Long Range] aspect can still be invoked as normal.

**Chain Shot:** Firing lengths of chain from the ship's guns gives a
better chance of inflicting serious damage to enemy sails. The ship
gains +2 to [[Shoot]] when attempting to create a negative aspect on a
target representing damaged sails.

**False Hull:** Cleverly built into the ship's structure, this hidden
space can store a small amount of cargo, less than 5% of the ship's
total cargo tonnage. Add +2 to the opposition to any attempts to find
the hidden cargo.

**Ramming Prow:** A reinforced, sharply pointed prow allows the ship to
deliver a ramming attack while minimizing harm to itself. When
delivering a ramming attack, the ship receives +2 to defend itself
against the damage from this attack. See Ship Combat for more
information on this.

## Ship Milestones

If your characters own or serve aboard a ship, the ship gets a milestone
when the characters do. The ship milesone is like a character milestone,
with two exceptions:

First, ships do not have refresh. At any major milestone, one player may
spend a point of refresh to buy a single stunt for the ship.

Second, the skill cap for the ship's crew is always one rank below the
skill cap for the characters.
