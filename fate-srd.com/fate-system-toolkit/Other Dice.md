# Other Dice

Don't have your Fate dice or Deck of Fate handy? Here are some
alternatives to get your game going.

## D6-D6

Take two six-sided dice of different colors. Designate one as the positive die and the other as the negative, and roll. Subtract the negative from the positive to get a result of -5 to +5. Doubles are always a zero. It's "swingier" than four Fate dice, and the range is broader, but it's close enough for jazz.

## Connect the Dots

This technique was first seen in [[BabysFirstFudgeDice.pdf|"Baby's First Fudge Dice" by Jonathan Walton]] at [sinisterforces.com](http://www.sinisterforces.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/BabysFirstFudgeDice.pdf) .

With a permanent marker and some pipped six-sided dice, you can make your _own_ Fate dice by connecting the dots. The 2 and 3 sides become your [-] sides, the 4 and 6 sides become your [0] sides, and the 5 and 1 sides become your [+] sides---you'll have to freehand the 1.

Ta-da---artisanal Fate dice!

## 3d6

If you go in for tables, or if you just have a good memory, you can roll
three six-sided dice.

|  3  |  4  | 5-6 | 7-8 | 9-12 | 13-14 | 15-16 |  17 |  18 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :-: | :-: |
|  -4 |  -3 |  -2 |  -1 |  +0  |   +1  |   +2  |  +3 |  +4 |

## 4d6

This one's the least work, but maybe not the most intuitive: roll four six-sided dice and treat 1s and 2s as [-], 3s and 4s as [0], and 5s and 6s as [+].
