# Aspect

An [[aspect]] is a word or phrase that describes something special about a person, place, thing, situation, or group. Almost anything you can think of can have aspects. A person might be the `Greatest Swordswoman on the Cloud Sea`. A room might be `On Fire` after you knock over an oil lamp. After a time-travel encounter with a dinosaur, you might be `Terrified`. Aspects let you change the story in ways that go along with your character's tendencies, skills, or problems.

Generally, you or someone else in the game will [[invoke]] a given aspect, usually paying a [[Fate Point]] to do so.

See [[The-Book-of-Hanz-Fate-Core-Thought-of-the-Day#What Do Aspects Do?|the Book of Hanz]] for some aspect info.

## Always True

An aspect is always true, even when it's not being [[invoke|invoked]].

## Grant Permission

One thing aspects can do is [[The-Book-of-Hanz-Fate-Core-Thought-of-the-Day#Grant permission|"grant permission"]].  Some things are necessary for other things to happen.  A character might need some magical training aspect like [Member of the Order of the Magi] in order to use magic, for instance.

## Establishing Facts

The final thing that aspects can do is **establish facts** in the game. You don't have to spend any [[fate point]]s, roll dice, or anything to make this happen---just by virtue of having the aspect `Ruddy Duck's Pilot`, you've established that your character is a pilot and that you fly a plane named the Ruddy Duck. Having the aspect `Mortal Enemy: The Red Ninjas` establishes that the setting has an organization called the Red Ninjas and that they're after you for some reason. If you take the aspect `Sorcerer of the Mysterious Circle`, you not only establish that there's a group of sorcerers called the Mysterious Circle, but that magic exists in the setting and that you can perform it.

When you establish facts of the setting this way, make sure you do it in cooperation with other players. If most people want to play in a setting without magic, you shouldn't unilaterally bring magic into it through an aspect. Make sure that the facts you establish through your aspects make the game fun for everyone.
