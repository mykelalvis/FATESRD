# Compelling Aspects

If you're in a situation where having or being around a certain aspect means your character's life is more dramatic or complicated, anyone can compel the aspect. You can even compel it on yourself---that's called a self-compel. Compels are the most common way for players to earn more [[fate point]]s.

There are two types of compels.

## Decision compels

This sort of compel suggests the answer to a decision your character has to make. If your character is `Princess of Alaria`, for example, you may need to stay to lead the defense of the Royal Alarian Castle rather than fleeing to safety. Or if you have a `Defiant Streak a Mile Wide`, maybe you can't help but mouth off to the Dean of Discipline when he questions you.

## Event compels

Other times a compel reflects something happening that makes life more complicated for you. If you have `Strange Luck`, of course that spell you're working on in class accidentally turns the dour Potions Master's hair orange. If you `Owe Don Valdeon a Favor`, then Don Valdeon shows up and demands that you perform a service for him just when it's least convenient.

In any case, when an aspect is compelled against you, the person compelling it offers you a [[fate point]] and suggests that the aspect has a certain effect---that you'll make a certain decision or that a particular event will occur. You can discuss it back and forth, proposing tweaks or changes to the suggested compel. After a moment or two, you need to decide whether to accept the compel. If you agree, you take the [[fate point]] and your character makes the suggested decision or the event happens. If you refuse, you must pay a [[fate point]] from your own supply. Yes, this means that if you don't have any [[fate point]]s, you can't refuse a compel!
