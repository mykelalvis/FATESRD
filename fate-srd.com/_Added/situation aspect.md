# Situation Aspect

These [[aspect]]s describe the surroundings that the action is taking place in. This includes aspects you create or discover using the [[Create Advantage]] action. A [[situation aspect]] usually vanishes at the end of the scene it was part of, or when someone takes some action that would change or get rid of it. Essentially, they last only as long as the situational element they represent lasts.

> **Examples**: `On Fire`; `Bright Sunlight`; `Crowd of Angry People`; `Knocked to the Ground`

To get rid of a [[situation aspect]], you can attempt an [[Overcome]] action to eliminate it, provided you can think of a way your character could accomplish it---dump a bucket of water on the `Raging Fire`, use evasive maneuvers to escape the enemy fighter that's `On Your Tail`. An opponent may use a [[Defend]] action to try to preserve the aspect, if they can describe how they do it.
