# Invoking Aspects

You invoke an aspect to give yourself a bonus or make things a bit harder for your opponent. You can invoke any aspect that you a) know about, and b) can explain how you use it to your advantage---including aspects on other characters or on the situation. Normally, invoking an aspect costs you a [[fate point]]---hand one of your [[fate point]]s to the GM. To invoke an aspect, you need to describe how that aspect helps you in your current situation.

> - I attack the zombie with my sword. I know zombies are  `Sluggish`, so that should help me.
> - I really want to scare this guy. I've heard he's `Scared of Mice`, so I'll release a mouse in his bedroom.
> - Now that the guard's `Distracted`, I should be able to sneak right by him.
> - This spell needs to be really powerful---I'm an `Archwizard of the Ancient Order`, and powerful spells are my bread and butter.

What does invoking the aspect get you? Choose one of the following effects:

- **Add a +2 bonus to your total.** This costs a [[fate point]].
- **Reroll the dice.** This option is best if you rolled really lousy (usually a −3 or −4 showing on the dice). This costs a [[fate point]].
- **Confront an opponent with the aspect.** You use this option when your opponent is trying something and you think an existing aspect   would make it harder for them. For instance, an alien thug wants to draw his blaster pistol, but he's `Buried in Debris`; you   spend a [[fate point]] to invoke that aspect, and now your opponent's level of difficulty is increased by +2.
- **Help an ally with the aspect.** Use this option when a friend could use some help and you think an existing aspect would make it   easier for them. You spend a [[fate point]] to invoke the aspect, and now your friend gets a +2 on their roll.

> **Important**: You can only invoke any aspect once on a given dice roll; you can't spend a stack of [[fate point]]s on one aspect and get a huge bonus from it. However, you can invoke several different aspects on the same roll.

If you're invoking an aspect to add a bonus or reroll your dice, wait until after you've rolled to do it. No sense spending a [[fate point]] if you don't need to!

## Free invocations

[[How to Do Stuff#Actions|Sometimes you can invoke an aspect for free]], without paying a [[fate point]]. If you create or discover an aspect through the [[Create Advantage]] action, the first invocation on it (by you or an ally) is free (if you succeeded with style, you get two freebies). If you cause a consequence through an attack, you or an ally can invoke it once for free. A [[boost]]is a special kind of aspect that grants one free invocation, then it vanishes.

## Invoking an Aspect

Whenever you're making a skill roll, and you're in a situation where an [[Invoking and Compelling Aspects|aspect might be able to help you]] you can spend a [[fate point]] to invoke it in order to change the dice result. **This allows you to either reroll the dice or add +2 to your roll, whichever is more helpful.** (Typically, +2 is a good choice if you rolled --2 or higher, but sometimes you want to risk a reroll to get that +4.) You do this after you've rolled the dice---if you aren't happy with your total.

**You also have to explain or justify how the aspect is helpful in order to get the bonus**---sometimes it'll be self-evident, and sometimes it might require some creative narrating.

You can spend more than one [[fate point]] on a single roll, gaining another reroll or an additional +2, as long as each point you spend invokes a different aspect.

> Cynere is trying to covertly goad a merchant into describing the security features of his personal vault by posing as a visiting dignitary. The merchant is giving her passive opposition at Good (+3), and her [[Deceive]] skill is Fair (+2).
>
> Lily rolls. She breaks even, getting a 0. That leaves her result at Fair, not enough to get the information she wants.
>
> She looks at her character sheet, then to Amanda, and says, "You know, long years of being [Tempted by Shiny Things] has taught me a thing or two about what's in a treasure hoard and what's not. I'm going to impress this merchant by talking about the rarest, most prized elements of his collection."
>
> Amanda grins and nods. Lily hands over a [[fate point]] to invoke the aspect, and gets to add +2 to her standing roll. This brings her result to a Great (+4), which exceeds the opposition. The duly impressed merchant starts to brag about his vault, and Cynere listens intently....

## Declaring a Story Detail

Sometimes, you want to add a detail that works to your character's advantage in a scene. For example, you might use this to narrate a convenient coincidence, like retroactively having the right supplies for a certain job ("Of course I brought that along!"), showing up at a dramatically appropriate moment, or suggesting that you and the NPC you just met have mutual clients in common.

To do this, you'll spend a [[fate point]]. You should try to justify your story details by relating them to your aspects. GMs, you have the right to veto any suggestions that seem out of scope or ask the player to revise them, especially if the rest of the group isn't buying into it.

> Zird the Arcane gets captured with his friends by some tribesfolk from the Sagroth Wilds. The three heroes are unceremoniously dumped before the chieftain, and Amanda describes the chieftain addressing them in a strange, guttural tongue.
>
> Ryan looks at his sheet and says, "Hey, I have `If I Haven't Been There, I've Read About It` on my sheet. Can I declare that I've studied this language at some point, so we can communicate?"
>
> Amanda thinks that's perfectly reasonable to assume. Ryan tosses over a [[fate point]] and describes Zird answering in the chieftain's own speech, which turns all eyes in the village (including those of his friends) on him in a moment of surprise.
>
> Ryan has Zird look at his friends and say, "Books. They're good for you."

## Compels

Sometimes (in fact, probably often), [[Invoking and Compelling Aspects|you'll find yourself in a situation where an aspect complicates]]  your character's life and creates unexpected drama. When that happens, the GM will suggest a potential complication that might arise. This is called a compel.

Sometimes, a compel means your character automatically fails at some goal, or your character's choices are restricted, or simply that unintended consequences cloud whatever your character does. You might negotiate back and forth on the details a little, to arrive at what would be most appropriate and dramatic in the moment.

Once you've agreed to accept the complication, you get a [[fate point]] for your troubles. If you want, you can pay a [[fate point]] to prevent the complication from happening, but it is not recommended that you do that very often---you'll probably need that [[fate point]] later, and getting compelled brings drama (and hence, fun) into your game's story.

Players, you're going to call for a compel when you want there to be a complication in a decision you've just made, if it's related to one of your aspects. GMs, you're going to call for a compel when you make the world respond to the characters in a complicated or dramatic way.

Anyone at the table is free to suggest when a compel might be appropriate for any character (including their own). GMs, you have the final word on whether or not a compel is valid. And speak up if you see that a compel happened naturally as a result of play, but no [[fate point]]s were awarded.

> Landon has the aspect [The Manners of a Goat]. He is attending the annual Grand Ball in Ictherya with his friends, courtesy of the royal court.
>
> Amanda tells the players, "As you're milling about, a sharply dressed young lady catches Landon sticking out of the crowd. She observes him for a while, then goes to engage him in conversation, obviously intrigued by how different he looks among all the stuffy nobles." She turns to Lenny. "What do you do?"
>
> Lenny says, "Uh... well, I guess I'll ask her to dance and play along, see what I can find out about her."
>
> Amanda holds up a [[fate point]] and says, "And is that going to go wrong, given Landon's excellent command of courtly etiquette?"
>
> Lenny chuckles and replies, "Yeah, I presume Landon will offend her pretty quickly, and that'll get complicated. I'll take the fate point."
>
> Amanda and Lenny play a bit to figure out just how Landon puts his foot in his mouth, and then Amanda describes some of the royal guard showing up. One of them says, "You might want to watch how you speak to the High Duchess of Ictherya, outlander."
>
> Lenny shakes his head. Amanda grins the grin of the devil.
