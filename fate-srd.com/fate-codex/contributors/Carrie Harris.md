**Carrie Harris** is the official Evil Hat Productions marketing manager
and official pink lion---her business card says so. Way back in the day,
she got her start freelancing for White Wolf but left to work in a lab
where they kept brains in jars on the counters. Now she's
brain-in-jar-free, which is a pity, but that gives her time to write
teen novels for Random House including Bad Taste in Boys and Demon
Derby. She also writes tie-in fiction for Evil Hat such as Sally Slick
and the Steel Syndicate and the upcoming Dinocalypse Forever, and she'll
soon be returning to her RPG roots with the publication of the Young
Centurions RPG, co-written with Clark Valentine. If she were a Fate
character, one of her aspects would be Sparkly New Idea! CANNOT
RESIST!!!
