**Marissa Kelly (MK)** grew up with roleplaying as a favorite hobby; her
father often made up house rules for classic roleplaying games, spinning
epic tales of bravery and heart. From a young age, MK was inspired to
draw the characters and scenes from these stories. As an adult, she now
finds herself drawn to tweaking and changing systems in order to bring
those kinds of experiences to a new generation of roleplayers. With her
partner, Mark Diaz Truman, she founded Magpie Games in early 2011 and
currently serves as Magpie's Senior Art Developer and one of its
designers.
