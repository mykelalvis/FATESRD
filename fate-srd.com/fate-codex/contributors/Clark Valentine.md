**Clark Valentine** has found a reasonably successful career as a part-time RPG freelance writer, and believe me, he's as shocked as you are about this. He likes running _Fate_ and _D&D_ and _*World_ games for his kids and his wife, editor [[Amanda Valentine]], and his friends. In his day job he writes software to make sure everyone gets paid on time, which is boring---until it isn't, at which point it gets pretty darn exciting. His children are already more accomplished than he is, and he wouldn't have it any other way.
