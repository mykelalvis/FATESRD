**Manuela Soriani** lives in the same small town in northern Italy where she was born in 1979; she studied to become an accountant, but Art asked to be part of her life. After six years in comic books for the Italian market (including Jonathan Steele for Star Comics), Manuela began creating both traditional paper books and animated apps for electronic devices. Around 2013, she added back comic book projects in her daily job, alongside children books and cover art. In early 2016, she was successfully backed for her first illustration book "Butterflies" and is currently working on the comic series _TIN_ (by Ilya Dvilyanski), _BoyLord_ (by Nathan Peabody), and _Girls Heist Out_ (by Rob Wieland).
