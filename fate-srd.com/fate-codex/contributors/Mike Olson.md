**Mike Olson** was born in Encino, California. Later in life, he got to work on some roleplaying games---for money! His credits include The Kerberos Club (Fate Edition), Jadepunk, and the ENnie Award-winning [[Fate Core]] System and Atomic Robo: The Roleplaying Game, among others. He resides in Southern California with his wonderful wife and two equally wonderful sons, but you can find him online on Twitter ([@devlin1](https://twitter.com/devlin1.html)) or at [spiritoftheblank.blogspot.com](http://spiritoftheblank.blogspot.com/). His other interests include drum corps, podcasts, kids' TV, and writing about himself in the third-person.
