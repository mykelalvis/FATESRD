**June Shores** has only been in the role play gaming hobby for a few
years now. Her first experience with a tabletop RPG was with Fate, back
when the Dresden Files RPG came out, and she has been in love with the
system ever since. With this new hobby came an all-consuming urge to
hack and drift games to suit her needs. From pastel-colored magic ponies
to anime-flavored fantasy, June has produced many solo projects that are
scattered across the internet today. This is her first time being
published. She attends The University of Maine at Farmington to pursue a
degree in new media and blogs at her web site, Headpigeons.
