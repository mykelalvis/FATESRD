# About The Fate Codex

*by [[Mark Diaz Truman]]*

A few weeks ago, a small idea crawled into my brain. It said, "Hey! You know that Patreon thing Epidiah Ravachol keeps talking about? You know those *Worlds Without Master* issues you keep getting? You should do something like that! For Fate!"

I said, "I'm kinda busy right now, little idea. I'm moving to New Mexico, and I've got a lot going on. You know, stuff to do."

The little idea persisted: "Come on! It will be great! We'll get cool articles from folks like Lenny Balsera and Ryan Macklin! You can write some of those quick adventures that you think about every time someone posts about adventure seeds on the [[Fate Core]] Google+ Community. Short fiction!"

I said, "Okay, little idea. That *does* sound pretty cool. Let's do it."  And The Fate Codex was born.

But I knew I couldn't do The Fate Codex alone. I need patrons, folks who were willing to support this work through the Patreon system. It's a great platform, one that makes projects like this possible, but I didn't know how much support we would get. I hoped at least a few people would back us, that we'd get enough support so that I could hire an editor, pay our contributors, and maybe even buy a little art.

The response blew me away. At this moment, nearly 300 people have collectively pledged more than \$800 an issue to make The Fate Codex a reality. The scope of the project has expanded dramatically---from just two articles to four pieces with illustrations and art---and I think we're going to keep growing. There's so much energy and excitement, and we don't yet know how far The Fate Codex will go!

So... thank you for your support. It means the world to me.
