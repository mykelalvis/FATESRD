Fate Codex

# About The Fate Codex

by Mark Diaz Truman

This month's issue feels a bit like getting the band back together, albeit with a new rhythm section. We're excited to feature two Fate Codex old-timers---André La Roche and June Shores---alongside a brand new contributor---Andrew Tuttle---who has been working with us for months to perfect his first Quick Start. A few more issues like this, and I think we'll be ready to take our show on the road.

We're about halfway through our third volume, and writing my piece for this issue made me reflect a bit on our journey so far. It's hard to believe we're nearly three years into The Fate Codex! It's been an honor to work with so many awesome folks over the years, and an even greater honor to see so many of them---André and June included---return to write for us a second or third time.

For this issue, I've written a piece with similar themes---what can Fate players and GMs learn from Apocalypse World?---to my work in "At What Cost" in Volume 2, and I'm thrilled to continue contributing to the awesome conversation our community is having when evaluating what the two systems have to offer. Never before has our community had so many great systems available for hacking, reusing, and adapting, and I can't wait to see what the next generation of systems has to offer.

Once again, thanks for your support! The Fate Codex Patreon makes so much great work possible for a diverse and exciting group of designers, and it's an honor to helm the project each and every issue. Special thanks, as always, to Tara Zuber for helping make this issue a reality!
