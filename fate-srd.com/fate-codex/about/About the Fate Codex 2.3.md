# About The Fate Codex

_by mark diaz truman_

As Editor in Chief of The Fate Codex, I sometimes feel like the head chef at a fancy restaurant, trying to figure out exactly which pieces go together, which articles combine into the right kind of overall dish. It's a balancing act, looking for pieces that are ready---or that are close enough to ready---to push forward and that fit whatever the mix is turning out to be this time around.

This month's issue is a meaty one: new fantasy fiction, an essay on [[Stealth]], a new system for conflicts, and the first historical fiction Quick Start. All in all, it's a fascinating exploration of war and fighting (or in the case of [[Stealth]], attempts to avoid fighting). We're looking at new ways to frame old conflicts---Don Bisdorf's piece is a World War II-style scrappy unit story set in a fantasy world---and new ways to use history you probably don't even know---Camp X is real, people!

This month's issue also comes hot on the heels of the last one, a definite return to our mostly-monthly schedule. We set the goal of ten issues this year (which now looks a bit out of range), but we're still excited to get out as many as we can before the end of the year. Volume 1 was over 400 pages of awesome Fate content, and we think Volume 2 deserves to be at least that big.

So thanks---once again---for your support. You absolutely make The Fate Codex a reality through your generous support. We literally couldn't do it without you.

Thank you!
