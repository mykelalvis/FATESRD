## The Garrund Family

The Garrund family's origin is lost to time, but for hundreds of
years---or at least as far back as anyone cares to check---they have
been a notable feature on the world stage. The family's plentiful money
has bought the best education and opportunities for its progeny, making
the family famous in many realms of human endeavor.

Until recently. Full of its own success, over time the family became
careless with its wealth and didn't notice soon enough that it was
trickling away. As many prosperous members distanced themselves from the
family, or married into others, it was only the actions of the current
Lady Garrund---a clever and meticulous woman---that began to reverse its
fortunes.

### The Lady

Lady Edith Marguerite Garrund has been the head of the Garrund family
for the last 27 years. Selected for her prudence when the family's
fortunes began to wane, she did much to turn the tide. But as old age
crept up on her, so too have some of the old problems begun to
resurface.

The Lady, now 68, lives in the family manor, alone but for her servants.
Though she holds her staff to a high standard, she is well liked by
them, and they know her so well that they often see to her needs before
she's aware she has them. She appreciates their attention; after half a
lifetime keeping the family afloat, she looks forward to seeing out her
last few years in relative comfort.

The Lady is a fan of life. She is eager to see her family perform for
her, and is open to trying almost anything they suggest to impress her.
However, this doesn't mean that the Lady has forgotten what's at stake
should the family fall into irresponsible hands; she is still shrewd,
and does not intend to see her years of good work go to waste.## Lady Garrund

### Notes

Lady Garrund uses Approaches instead of skills, as detailed on below.### The Garrund Family Legacy

Lady Garrund, accepting that her end is near, is looking to name an heir
from among her descendants. After a healthy and prosperous life, she has
many children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces, and their spouses to
choose from, and it's up to each of them to demonstrate that they are
worthy of inheriting the family's ancient estate and being named the
next Lady, or Lord, of Garrund Manor, the family's ancestral home.

The Lady has called all of her potential heirs back to the manor. She
plans on spending time with each of them to determine how successful
they have been, and how suitable they would be to take over the family
estate. Each of the relatives, knowing what's at stake, strives to put
their best foot forward in the hope of being chosen. The family is not
in the clear yet; the Lady knows that another disastrous heir would
spell the end of her hard-won gains.

Only, strange things often happen in the Garrund family when succession
is on the line. Implausible accidents and unlikely mishaps plague the
potential successors, with even the best-planned displays of worthiness
coming apart at just the wrong moment. The hopefuls may bicker and point
fingers at each other, but the truth is somewhat stranger.

### The Ghosts of Garrund

The Garrund dynasty is haunted. Not by malicious spirits, but by the
ghosts of deceased family members who can't bear to let their
descendants go. They watch from the afterlife and make a tweak here, a
small change there, helping the family prosper and thrive. They also
pick favorites and squabble---as all who spend too much time together
do---and their differences come to a head when it comes to the matter of
succession.

Whenever the Garrund family gather to pick a new head, the squabbling of
the Ghosts becomes a competition, with each of the deceased championing
their personal favorite. They stop making only small, beneficial actions
and instead take a far more active hand in the fate of the family.

Each Ghost's objective is simple: to ensure that their candidate is
ultimately chosen as the new Lord or Lady Garrund. To do this, they
follow their chosen successor and watch over their efforts to impress
the incumbent Lady, providing assistance where necessary. The Ghosts
also interfere with the efforts of their competitors, trying to make the
other candidates look foolish or incompetent in front of her. As the
time of choosing grows near, the Ghosts are more active than ever; who
will emerge as the new Lord or Lady?

## Setting Creation

As a Quick Start Adventure, Family Matters has everything you need to
jump right into a generations-old battle for succession. Family Matters
is designed as a single-session, competitive game in which you and your
friends play the Ghosts of Garrund, embroiled in a fight over whose
chosen successor will become the heir of an ancient family, and it uses
mechanics from both [[Fate Core]] and Fate Accelerated to create two levels
of engaging conflicts.

At the start of the game, explain the **current issue**, `The
Inheritance], to your players and ask them to choose from one
of the two available **impending issues**, `The Lost [[Will]]] or
`The Feral Spirit], which should be introduced by the GM during
the game. You might also want to read aloud a few sections like "The
Lady" or "The Garrund Family Legacy."### Arguing Through the Ages

Family Matters walks you through creating a light-fantasy style game,
but you could also adapt it to play ancient AIs manipulating a
futuristic virtual world, meddling fairies disturbing an old wizard
trying to pick from among his apprentices, or any other setting you can
imagine in which the intangible players interfere with an oblivious
group of competitors.### Current Issue: The Inheritance

The most pressing issue on everyone's mind, and the reason they're all
gathered back at the family manor, is `The Inheritance]. The
aim of each Ghost, and each potential heir, is to make sure that the
Lady chooses the correct person as her successor, and all efforts
initially go towards influencing her decision.

### Impending Issues

To complicate the matter of `The Inheritance], a number of
other factors could come in to play, drastically influencing the
family's situation and distracting those involved. These factors
include:

#### The Lost [[Will]]

On a rainy morning, Mr. Quarell, of Quarell and Sons, arrives at the
manor. He asks for an audience with Lady Garrund as a matter of urgency
and, when they meet, presents to her a will from Lord Bartholemew
Garrund, the previous head of the family. In it, Lord Garrund leaves the
entire estate to a local church. Mr. Quarell claims the will had been
lost and has only just been uncovered, but that he will be relaying a
copy of the will to the church shortly and suggests that the family
should plan to move out very, very soon.## Mr. Quarell

### Aspects

High Concept: `Efficient Lawyer]

Trouble: `Butterfingers]

### Approaches

Good +3: Careful

Fair +2: Clever, Quick

Average +1: Forceful, Sneaky

Mediocre +0: Flashy

### Consequences

Mild (2) | Moderate (4) | Severe (6)

### Stress

□□□#### The Feral Spirit

One night, the Ghosts of Garrund feel a strange presence enter their
lands. Upon investigation, they find a wild, animalistic spirit stalking
the grounds, which, upon spotting them, attacks! The Ghosts quickly find
that the spirit cannot influence the corporeal world or harm mortals,
but is perfectly capable of, and intent on, hurting them. When dealing
with the Feral Spirit, the Ghosts use their Fate skills normally. In
addition, when the Spirit comes into play, each Ghost gains three Stress
boxes (see "Character Creation," page 38). If their Stress is depleted,
the Ghost dissipates and can no longer participate in the scene,
reforming back at the Manor before the next scene begins. If the Feral
Spirit's Stress boxes are filled, it also dissipates, reforming
elsewhere to return later in the game.## The Feral Spirit

### Stress

□□□### Area of Play: The Grounds

The Garrund family have held power in the local area for generations and
rule over much of the nearby land. Family Matters takes place in the
lands owned by the family, through which both the mortals and the Ghosts
can move freely.

The heart of the estate is **Garrund Manor**, the family's ancestral
home and the Lady's current residence. The Manor is grand and spacious,
but some wings stand empty and abandoned where the Lady has been forced
to sell off the family's artefacts to pay its debts. It's located high
on a cliff overlooking a grey sea, with a treacherous path connecting it
to a small, private harbor at the cliff's base.

The nearby settlement of **Wedawyn**, located on a costal trade route,
is a town of two parts. Near the coast, the town is populated by surly,
suspicious fishermen and farmers. They are generally content just to get
through the day, hopefully with food on their plates when it ends.
Moving inland, the town becomes less ramshackle, with establishments
catering to travelers on the road and a busy market where passing
merchants and the locals gather to sell their wares.

In the other direction lies the **Davenwood**, the Garrund family's
private hunting grounds. The wood hides many wild animals, and the
occasional poacher, under its thickly leafed boughs and a mysterious
atmosphere permeates its overgrown heart.

There are many other treats hidden in the family's grounds, such as
**Farmer Jed's horse racing track**, set up after his crops failed for
one year too many, or, rumor has it, a **beautiful secluded cove**
hidden among the cliffs that young couples seek out for some private
time, so long as they remember to get out before the tide comes in. The
potential successors will likely know of a few secret or interesting
places of their own to which they will wish to take the Lady.

## Character Creation

Making a character in Family Matters is slightly different to making one
in standard [[Fate Core]]. Each player creates two characters---a Ghost and
the potential heir the Ghost wishes to see succeed---following the rules
below.

### The Ghosts of Garrund

#### Aspects

The Ghosts of Garrund have four aspects: High Concept, Trouble, and two
Beliefs. Their High Concept describes who they were when they were alive
and how they died, their Trouble aspect is something that complicates
their existence, and their Beliefs are things about their character, or
the world, that they hold close to their heart.

#### Skills

Family Matters uses the standard [[Fate Core]] skill list and pyramid,
peaking for the Ghosts at Great +4. However, the skills don't function
in the same way for the deceased as they do for the living; look below
for descriptions of the skills as the Ghosts can make use of them during
play.

In general, the difficulty of a roll is determined by how irregular or
unusual it is for an object or person to behave in the way the Ghosts
wants them to behave: it's much harder to make a calm person angry or to
make a scary forest seem serene.

**[[Athletics]]:** [[Athletics]] allow a Ghost to force a mortal to take a brief
physical action, such as throwing a punch or flipping a switch. If the
action goes against the mortal's wishes, it is opposed by the mortal's
Careful. If the action is complicated or difficult, excess [[shift]]s
determine if the mortal's actions succeed.

**[[Burglary]]:** [[Burglary]] can be used to mysteriously spirit items to
another location within the grounds. Characters observing the object may
roll [[Notice]], Careful, or Sneaky to spot the item vanishing, opposed by
excess [[shift]]s on the Overcome roll.

**[[Contacts]]:** [[Contacts]] can be used to draw NPCs of a specified type or
temperament to a certain location. [[Shift]]s on this Overcome roll dictate
how many NPCs are drawn, and how closely their temperament matches that
which the player desires.

**Craft:** Craft can be used to make mundane objects perform their
normal function. This ranges from making a clock chime or a door open to
animating a mop and bucket to clean the floor. In the right
circumstances, Craft can be used to Attack, such as when making an aimed
gun fire or an explosive detonate.

**[[Deceive]]:** [[Deceive]] can be used to create intangible illusions to
confuse and disorientate mortals. The GM may allow a mortal to oppose
the illusion with Clever.

**[[Drive]]:** [[Drive]] can be used to make a vehicle---including horse-drawn
carriages---operate without a driver. [[Shift]]s on this Overcome or Create
Advantage roll work as if the Ghost were driving the vehicle directly.
In the right circumstances, [[Drive]] can be used to make an Attack roll,
such as when knocking someone down with a vehicle.

**[[Empathy]]:** [[Empathy]] can be used to haunt an area with a specific
feeling, such as making a dark forest seem suddenly spooky or peaceful.
Remember that it's easier to make a rose-scented bedchamber feel
romantic than it is a dung-filled stable.

**[[Fight]]:** [[Fight]] can be used to attempt to physically harm mortals
through manipulation of the environment in a plausible way, such as
having a window shut on someone's fingers, a wagon wheel break and throw
the rider, or a leaning tree finally give up and fall on someone. This
skill can be used to make an Attack roll against a target in the same
zone as the Ghost. Attacks made with this skill could always be
construed as unfortunate accidents. By moving the scenery in useful
ways, characters may also make Create Advantage, Overcome, or Defend
rolls using this skill.

**[[Investigate]]:** [[Investigate]] allows Ghosts to uncover previously hidden
details about mortals. [[Shift]]s on this [[create advantage]] roll are opposed
by a difficulty set by the GM, based on how outlandish the new details
are; for instance, uncovering that someone is left-handed would be
easier than uncovering that someone is secretly the head of a worldwide
criminal organization.

**[[Lore]]:** [[Lore]] can be used to provide mortals with a mental flash of
inspiration, gifting them with knowledge they did not previously
possess. [[Shift]]s on this Overcome or [[create advantage]] roll are opposed by
a difficulty set by the GM, based on how improbable their insight is.

**[[Notice]]:** [[Notice]] can be used to focus a mortal's attention on
something specific or alert them to danger. If successful, the GM
focuses the mortal's attention on something of the Ghost's choice.

**[[Physique]]:** [[Physique]] can be used to create impassable spiritual
barriers. [[Shift]]s on this [[create advantage]] roll are opposed by a
difficulty set by the GM, based on how large the desired barrier is,
with excess [[Shift]]s setting the difficulty of the Overcome roll needed to
pass through the barrier. These barriers can be invoked to block mortals
from harm.

**[[Provoke]]:** [[Provoke]] can be used to implant mental suggestions in a
mortal or a non-sentient being. [[Shift]]s on this [[create advantage]] or
Overcome roll are opposed by the target's Careful, Forceful, or [[Will]], as
appropriate.

**[[Rapport]]:** [[Rapport]] can be used to affect the emotional state of
mortals and non-sentient beings. Targets receive an emotional focus, but
the Ghost would need to use [[Provoke]] to plant a specific suggestion.

**[[Resources]]:** [[Resources]] can be used to provide a mortal with an item
they need by forcing an item the Ghost owns through the veil and into
the corporeal world. Remember that it's more likely a Ghost would own a
sword or pocket watch than a fighter jet.

**[[Shoot]]:** [[Shoot]] can be used to telekinetically throw objects at
targets, such as causing a kitchen knife to wrench itself from the table
and fly across the room, or hurling a stone from a riverbank at the
passengers of a passing boat. This skill can be used to make an Attack
roll against a target up to one zone away. Attacks made with this skill
always seem unusual and unnatural to those observing them. By moving the
scenery in useful ways, characters may also make Create Advantage,
Overcome, or Defend rolls using this skill.

**[[Stealth]]:** [[Stealth]] can be used to render physical objects, or people,
invisible, or at least make them harder to notice. [[Shift]]s on this Create
Advantage roll are opposed by a difficulty set by the GM based on how
large or obvious the item is; e.g., a theater ticket would be easier to
hide than a building.

**[[Will]]:** [[Will]] can be used to counter the interference of other Ghosts.
Used in response to another Ghost taking an action, [[shift]]s on this
Defend roll directly subtract from the [[shift]]s that other Ghosts roll
when using their abilities, even if the Defending Ghost was not the
target of the roll.### Things That Go Bump in the Night

While mortals aren't aware of a Ghost's presence outside of any obvious
physical manifestations, one caveat of Family Matters is that Ghosts are
always aware of when another Ghost is using one of the abilities listed
above.#### Stunts

Each Ghost possesses one stunt, giving them access to a unique ghostly
ability in addition to the abilities provided by their Skills. Stunts
can do one of three things: add a new Action to a Skill, add a bonus to
an Action, or create a rules exception. When creating your stunt, build
it off the ghostly version of the skill, not the mundane one!

#### Stress and Consequences

The Ghosts of Garrund do not suffer Stress or Consequences; they're
already dead, how much worse can it get? Instead, they fight their
battles through their chosen descendants.### Can't Touch This

In Family Matters, the Ghosts cannot directly attack each other. Instead
they work through their proxies---those in the running for the
succession---by engineering situations to boost the prestige of their
own chosen candidate while interfering with the efforts of their
competitors. This is made possible by the ghostly twist on the standard
Skill list, allowing Ghosts to create effects in the corporeal world.#### Refresh

Each Ghost has three Refresh, which may not be spent on additional
Stunts.

#### Additional Rule: Movement

Ghosts can float in three dimensions at normal movement rates and can
pass through corporeal objects. They may also ethereally transport
themselves to any other Ghost or any point within the Grounds at will,
dematerializing from their current location and materializing at their
chosen destination a few seconds later.

### The Successors

#### Aspects

Each potential heir has only two aspects: a High Concept and a Trouble.
These are created as per the normal [[Fate Core]] rules.

#### Approaches

Lady Garrund, the players' chosen heirs, and other mortals in Family
Matters are created using a cut-down skill system called Approaches,
based on Fate Accelerated Edition rules.

Rather than possessing a full list of Skills, characters' Approaches
describe six ways in which they may accomplish any task, as long as
their player can justify how it applies to the task at hand. The six
Approaches are:

- Careful
- Clever
- Flashy
- Forceful
- Quick
- Sneaky

Mortals possess one Approach at Good (+3), two at Fair (+2), two at
Average (+1), and one at Mediocre (+0).

#### Stunts and Refresh

The successors do not possess Stunts or Refresh.

#### Stress and Consequences

Each potential heir possesses three Stress boxes which are used for both
Physical and Mental stress. They also possess the standard Mild,
Moderate, and Severe Consequences.### Seeing Double

While each player gets to create two characters, they do not necessarily
have to play them both. Discuss whether you would prefer to have the
players controlling their own heirs or whether the GM should control all
the mortals. Giving the GM control puts significantly more emphasis on
the squabbling Ghosts than their mortal protégés.``

## Game Structure

A game of Family Mattersis broken into three acts. The bulk of the game
takes place in the second act, which is repeated multiple times. This
main section is bookended by an introductory and a closing act.

### Opening Act: Presentation of the Candidates

The act of choosing a successor is a highly formalized affair for the
Garrund Family. The game begins at a grand ball organized by Lady
Garrund, to which she has invited all of her potential heirs so they may
discuss the inheritance.

A few hours into the ball, the attendees break for dinner and are seated
at the Lady's table, where she questions them about their lives,
successes, and desires. Her memory refreshed, she explains to them that
she will be spending time over the next few days with each candidate to
get to know them before making her decision regarding the succession.

During this act, the players are encouraged to show off their
candidates, describing what they do at the ball before the meal and
playing through the scene with Lady Garrund. If the group decided to let
the GM control their candidates, this scene allows the GM to see how
they behave before assuming control of them from this point onwards.

The Ghosts of Garrund, of course, are also present at the ball. During
this act, their game also begins as they begin undermining and
embarrassing their opponents' candidates and promoting their own. During
the scene, the Ghosts' aim is to place Aspects on their and their
opponents' candidates to begin shaping the Lady's view of them.### The Mad World

To avoid the candidates being dogpiled and overwhelmed by their
opponents' ghostly patrons, and to ensure they aren't living in a world
that's gone totally haywire, the Ghosts must pay one Fate Point to make
an action that affects the corporeal world. They may augment this action
by spending further Fate Points as usual. The only exception to this is
during the Middle Act, where the player whose scene it is does not need
to pay Fate Points to actively defend their chosen. Fate Points refresh
at the end of each scene.### Middle Act: The Competition

From this point onwards the game is divided into rounds. Each round,
every player gets to set a scene for the GM to run in which their
candidate, aided by their Ghost, tries to impress the Lady, with the
other players interfering as they will. During the scenes, Lady Garrund
should challenge her potential heirs about a character flaw she
perceives, setting them a task to prove their ability to overcome it.

Scenes can take place anywhere on the Garrund family grounds. Unless the
player's desired scene seems unreasonable, the group should assume the
grounds are large and well-equipped enough to accommodate their request.
Once each player has had a scene the round ends.

There is no limit to how many rounds can take place, but an end point
should be agreed upon before the game begins. Allow around 20 minutes
for each scene and count your players to estimate how long each round
will take and pick a number of rounds accordingly.

Once the scene is over, the GM should score how well the player's
performance was received. Taking into account Lady Garrund's
personality, as well as the character's performance in the face of any
challenges and interference, the GM should award the player zero points
for a disastrous scene, one point for a poorly received scene, two
points for a well-received scene and three points for an exceptional
scene. Keep the scores secret, but adapt how Lady Garrund treats the
participants based on their running total.### Playing Dirty

With the family's legacy on the line, events in Family Matters can get a
little heated. Sometimes this can result in the death of one of the
potential successors---accidentally or purposefully---leaving the Ghost
who had been championing the successor out of the competition.

Should this happen, the Ghosts of the deceased successors can make it
their mission to ruin their rival's chances. The players of the Ghosts
continue in the game, either siding with one or all of the other players
to help them win, or just victimizing the chosen of their rival. Players
should be wary of killing another contender, as it creates them an
unstoppable enemy for the remainder of the game and seriously damages
their own chances of victory.### Closing Act: Choosing the Heir

Once the competition is over, the Ghosts and candidates congregate in
the Lady's hall to hear who she names as her heir. Should multiple
players be tied for points, this scene becomes a tie-breaker; one final
point becomes available for the tying heir who best keeps their
composure before the Ghosts' final onslaught. Play this scene in
character, but keep the GM's notes on hand as to how they scored each
round so players are able to see how the Lady reached the decision she
did.

## What Next?

Family Matters is designed as a one-off game, but if your group wanted
to, the story could easily be extended. Two suggestions of how to do
this are presented below.

### Over and Over

Once the matter of the succession is settled, the Garrund family falls
back into its usual pattern. A short time later Lady Garrund passes away
and the chosen heir assumes control of the estate.

Many years later, the new Lord or Lady Garrund decides it's time to
choose an heir of their own. They summon a new selection of potential
heirs to Garrund Manor, getting the Ghosts' attention and beginning the
new round of the game.

The winner of the current session of Family Matters becomes the GM for
the next session, playing the new Lord or Lady, and watching over the
next generation of hopefuls vying for attention. The new GM narrates how
the family, and the world, has changed and designs some new **impending
issues** to be introduced during the next session. Players keep their
Ghost, but design a new mortal to compete for the inheritance.

### All for One

Without Lady Garrund's steady hand, the family's fortunes once again
begin to deteriorate and they are beset by new troubles. The family
rallies around their new Lord or Lady and sets out to change their fate.

To the Ghosts' surprise, they discover they are able to accompany their
descendants outside of the family's grounds so long as they stay
reasonably close to them. The family, aided by their spiritual
guardians, embarks on a series of adventurous and daring schemes to save
their name and put the family back in the global limelight.

Players retain control of both of their characters and the game [[shift]]s
to a more episodic narrative, following their exploits.

## Sample Characters## Colonel Abyndon B. Gaffy

Colonel Gaffy served abroad, died fighting for his country, and lives on
determined to tell anyone he can about it. He has a military love of
order and discipline, but after dying a gruesome death, now abhors the
overuse of violence. He values people with practical skills and thinks
someone who has proven themselves a success already in life would be
best suited to take over the family legacy.

## Ms. Florence Harrington-Walsh, Gaffy's Chosen One

Florence Harrington was born outside of the Garrund family, but married
into the distant Walsh branch. While initially repressed by her husband,
his untimely death allowed her to make her passion into her career and
she used the money she'd been left to travel the world, becoming a
successful botanist. She is well respected in scientific circles and has
made back her money through her works---presenting her findings to
learned circles and patenting new formulas and medicines she creates.

## Lady Louise Hartnett

Lady Hartnett is the incumbent Lady Garrund's aunt. She was pleased to
see one of the "close family" take the seat when the succession last
came around, and is keen to see that the same happens again; she finds
the idea of anyone who is not a family by blood taking her seat
exquisitely distasteful. She enjoyed the finer things in life and deeply
misses being able to partake of them. Time has only made her tongue more
barbed, even after it got her killed.

### Aspects

## Lord Woolf Garrund-Minnett, Hartnett's Chosen One

Lord Garrund-Minnett represents the current peak of local nobility as
one half of the happy (and politically fortuitous) joining of the
Garrunds to the rich Minnett family through marriage. Very aware of how
important his marriage to the Minnett heir is to the Garrund family, and
how much wealth he now has access to through her, he lords his position
over the rest of his family and treats them more like servants with each
passing day.
