# Random Character Creation In [[Fate Core]]

by Philippe Saner

Ever wish that you could literally roll up a Fate character? Roll some
dice, consult some tables, and watch a character take shape before your
eyes? If so, today's your lucky day! In this article, I present a
lifepath system that creates a character from four simple rolls and a
series of tables.

The system presented here has four primary goals: speed, surprise,
interest, and balance. In other words, the lifepath system quickly
produces characters that are consistently interesting, fun to play, and
more or less equally viable and effective.Let's get started!### Venture City Tables

If you're playing a Venture City game, I've done all of the work you
need to use the lifepath system. If you want to create characters in
another setting, you need to spend some time making tables, which can be
pretty fun if you like to tinker with tables.## The System

There are five phases to creating a character in this system. In each of
the first four phases, you roll four fate dice and use your result to
pick a cell on a table like this one:

Venture City Powers

---

Negator               Telepathy   Telekensis   Regeneration   Doppelganger
Shapeshifting         Brick       Speedster    X-Ray Vision   Flamer
Chameleon             Ghost       Metalhead    Insect         Oracle

If you roll 0000, pick the top left cell. For each + you roll, move one
cell to the right. For each - you roll, move one cell down. For example,
if you roll ++-0 you'd end up at _Speedster_ on this table.

## Adding Aspects

In your chosen cell, you'll find a prompt like _Flamer_, _Telepathy_, or
_Regeneration_. You can use this prompt directly as one of your
character aspects, but I encourage you to reword and reshape it to suit
your character better.

> Tomas rolls +--- on the Venture City Powers table and gets Insect
> for his prompt. He decides to create the aspect [Part of the
> Hive] to represent his connection to the insect kingdom.

## Adding Skills

In addition to helping you create aspects, each prompt also corresponds
to a set of skills. Perhaps a _Flamer_ has Good (+3) [[Provoke]] and Good (+3) [[Shoot]]. Although the skills vary with each prompt, you get the same
skill points from each table; e.g., the table in the first phase will
always grant you one skill at Fair (+2) and three skills at Average (+1). If you roll through all four phases, you can count on getting
three Good skills, three Fair skills, and four Average skills.

> Tomas looks at the full prompt for Insect and finds that it gives him
> Good (+3) [[Notice]] and Good (+3) [[Physique]]. He notes those both down on
> his character sheet.

## Other Details

It's likely that you'll get some duplicate skills. If you do, don't add
them together. Just note that you got a duplicate.You'll address those
in the final step of character creation.

Sometimes a prompt gives you a stunt or extra in addition to filling in
your skill slots. For example, a _Flamer_ might get the Flamer
superpower directly from Venture City.

On occasion, a prompt also affects how you roll during the following
phase or phases. I'll explain more about that in a moment.

## Finalizing the Character

Regardless, the first four phases are fairly simple. Roll, consult the
table for your prompt, follow the instructions, then move on to the next
phase and next table.

The fifth phase is a bit more complicated. There are five parts to it.

1. Raise one of your Good (+3) skills to Great (+4).
2. If there are duplicate skills on your sheet, erase all but the
   highest entry for each skill. This opens up some empty spaces in
   your skill pyramid; for each empty space, add one to a skill from
   the level below it. This opens up another empty space; fill it the
   same way. Repeat until you have ten different skills.
3. Buy stunts (if you have slots available).
4. Decide on a high concept for your character and fiddle with your
   other aspects until you're satisfied with them.
5. Look over your character sheet as a whole, and change whatever you
   think needs changing. It's your character, so feel free to tweak the
   results the system gives you.[ [

And that's it! A quick four rolls, and you've got a new Fate character
ready to go. Read on for some examples that show you how the system
works in greater detail.

## Venture City Tables

The following tables can be used to generate a superhero or a
supervillain in Venture City. They're here partly so you can use them,
and partly so you can see how lifepath-based character creation works.

### Phase One: Upbringing

The first phase tells you what your childhood was like and whether
you're a have or a have-not. It gives you a Fair skill and three Average
skills.

Upbringing

---

Recent Immigrant   Raised by a Corp   Athletic Child        Self-Made Success   Corporate Heir
Mafia Family       Wageslave Family   Professional Family   Academic Child      Criminal Child
Underclass         Rural Family       Wash-Out              Anarchist Family    Homeless

This table has a special corporate mechanic: If you get more + than -,
you're part of the corporate hierarchy. If you get more - than +, you're
not. If you get an equal number of each, you can decide whether or not
you'd like to be corporate.

**Academic Child**

You were a bright child, and you were educated well. +2 [[Lore]], +1 [[Crafts]],
+1 [[Investigate]], +1 [[Resources]]

Your parents were genuinely anti-corporate, and raised you accordingly.
+2 [[Lore]], +1 [[Contacts]], +1 [[Empathy]], +1 [[Will]]

**Athletic Child**

You displayed real athletic potential as a child, and once aimed at
professional sports. +2 [[Athletics]], +1 [[Physique]], +1 [[Stealth]], +1 [[Will]]

**Criminal Child**

You've been stealing since you were small. Maybe you learned it from
your parents, maybe not. +2 [[Burglary]], +1 [[Deceive]], +1 [[Notice]], +1 [[Stealth]]

**Corporate Heir**

At least one of your parents was highly ranked in a major corporation.
You were raised to be like them. +2 [[Contacts]], +1 [[Deceive]], +1 [[Rapport]], +1

Your parents were homeless. You slept in shelters or on the streets,
with one eye open either way. +2 [[Notice]], +1 [[Burglary]], +1 [[Stealth]], +1
[[Will]]

**Mafia Family**

Your parents were criminals. The kind that belong to a very scary
organization. +2 [[Contacts]], +1 [[Provoke]], +1 [[Resources]], +1 [[Will]]

**Professional Family**

Your parents were middle-managers or other ordinarily well-off people.
+2 [[Resources]], +1 [[Contacts]], +1 [[Lore]], +1 [[Physique]]

tough. +2 [[Provoke]], +1 [[Notice]], +1 [[Physique]], +1 [[Will]]

**Recent Immigrant**

You grew up a long way from Venture City. +2 [[Empathy]], +1 [[Notice]], +1

the corporate hierarchy. +2 [[Will]], +1 [[Provoke]], +1 [[Rapport]], +1 [[Resources]]

comfort. +2 [[Physique]], +1 [[Athletics]], +1 [[Crafts]], +1 [[Will]]

**Wageslave Family**

You were raised by corporate drones. It was weirdly normal. +2 [[Drive]], +1

**Wash-Out**

You had opportunities. You pissed them away, despite other people being
very willing to help you. +2 [[Rapport]], +1 [[Contacts]], +1 [[Deceive]], +1
[[Empathy]]

## Phase Two: Career

The second phase tells you either what you did before you got your
powers or what you do now, depending on what you roll. There are two
tables here; the first is for corporate characters and the second is for
non-corporate ones. They both give you a stunt, a Good (+3) skill, a
Fair (+2) skill, and an Average (+1) skill.

You're self-destructively heroic. +2 [[Will]]

## New powers

### Negator

**Powers:** You can create an anti-power field, adding +4 to the
opposition whenever anyone in your zone uses a power. If there's no
opposition, the user must make a Great (+4) [[Will]] roll to use their
power. When you touch someone, you can shut down their powers completely
until the end of your next turn. This requires a [[Fight]] attack if they're
resisting. In addition, you can tell if someone's powered and roughly
what their powers are.

**Special Effects:** Inflict a Condition, Forced Movement

**Drawback:** [Exhausting]

**Collateral Damage Effect:** You cause a helpless person's powers to go
wildly out of control for a moment and then disappear for a week.

**Cost:** 3 stunts

**Breakdown:** Basic Power Nullification, Master Power Nullification,
and Full Nullification

### Shapeshifting

**Powers:** You can transform into any sort of creature, rolling with
[[Will]] to create a [Creature Form ]advantage. The difficulty is
generally Mediocre (+0) but may be higher for huge, tiny, or complicated
forms. When you do so, select a skill and add +2 to that skill for as
long as you remain transformed. You can also grow wings to fly with
[[Athletics]], sprout blades for a +2 bonus to "unarmed" [[Fight]] attacks, and
harden your skin to gain Armor:2.

**Special Effects:** Area Attack, Physical Recovery

**Drawback:** [Really Creepy]

**Collateral Damage Effect:** You cause a part of your body to split off
and become a monster. Unfortunately, you have very little control over
creatures created this way.

**Cost:** 6 stunts

**Breakdown:** Basic Shape-Shifting, Master Shape-Shifting,
Skill-Shifting, Basic Flight, Basic Natural Weapon, Basic Super
Toughness, Corruption Power Theme

### X-Ray Vision

**Powers:** By bathing everything you look at in x-rays, you can see
through objects. This lets you see in perfect darkness and ignore
physical obstacles when using [[Notice]] or [[Investigate]]. You get +2 to
[[Investigate]] when using your vision. You may use [[Shoot]] to attack targets
within three zones with a concentrated x-ray beam.

**Special Effects:** Area Attack, Inflict a Condition

**Drawback:** [Gives People Cancer]

**Collateral Damage Effect:** If you're willing to do some damage, you
can release a huge burst of x-rays that will permanently damage the
health of everyone nearby.

**Cost:** 3 stunts

**Breakdown:** Basic Super Senses, Basic Energy Blast, new Super Senses
Enhancement to see through objects

## Full Example: Taylor Williams

Let's put those rules into action. We'll call our sample character
Taylor Williams.

### First Roll: -++-

The Upbringing table says Taylor had a **Rural Upbringing** and gets +2
[[Crafts]], +1 [[Physique]], +1 [[Drive]], and +1 [[Athletics]].

Since we rolled an equal number of + and -, we can choose which table to
roll on for the second roll. Let's go with the Corporate table.

### Second Roll: +0++

The Corporate table says Taylor is a **Corporate Spy**. She gets +3
[[Stealth]], +2 [[Deceive]], +1 [[Burglary]], and a stunt letting her spend a fate
point to receive information from her corporate masters.

### Third Roll: +-+0

The Superpowers table says Taylor is a **Speedster** and gets +3 [[Fight]]
and +3 [[Athletics]]. She already has +1 [[Athletics]], but the skills don't
stack. She'll pick which one she wants in the cleanup phase.

### Fourth Roll: Automatic + and Random +0+

The Trouble table says Taylor is mixed up in **Corporate Politics**. She
gets +2 [[Contacts]] and a stunt adding +2 to her [[Contacts]] rolls within the
company.

### Cleanup

So now we've got to weave all this together into a character. Let's say
Taylor grew up unsatisfied in a small town with no prospects. She
practically sold herself to Mitsuhama just to get away from her boring
hometown. They erased her identity, gave her powers, and trained her as
a covert operative.

That was years ago, and now Taylor is one of Mitsuhama's top agents. She
still looks and acts like a small-town girl, but underneath that facade
she's one of the deadliest people around and a major player within the
company. Let's change[ Rural Upbringing] to [Not Just a
Hick], and [Corporate Spy] to [Erased
Identity]. We'll pick [Adrenaline Junkie] as her power
aspect. Her trouble works just fine as [Corporate Politics], so
we'll leave that alone.

Her skill pyramid looks like this:

- Good (+3): [[Athletics]], [[Fight]], [[Stealth]]
- Fair (+2): [[Contacts]], [[Crafts]], [[Deceive]]
- Average (+1): [[Athletics]], [[Burglary]], [[Drive]], [[Physique]]

She has [[Athletics]] twice. We erase her Average [[Athletics]] and give her +1
[[Will]] to replace it. To emphasize her deadliness, we'll pick [[Fight]] as her
apex skill.

For Taylor's high concept, [Top Mitsuhama Agent] seems fitting.## Taylor Williams

High Concept: [Top Mitsuhama Agent]

ask her corporate masters three questions. They will respond with the
best information they have on hand.
