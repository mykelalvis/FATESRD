# Negotiations in Fate

by Mark Diaz Truman

One of my favorite parts of roleplaying is that I get to play characters
who can do things I never could: master archers and badass street
fighters, werewolves with magic rituals and cyborgs that can hack any
computer on the planet. It never matters that I can't shoot a bow, throw
a punch, mess with magic, or operate any computer program more
complicated than a word processor; my character is the one doing all
that stuff, not me.

But there are situations in roleplaying in which player skill and
character skill overlap, especially around social skills. If I roleplay
out convincing a villain to change his ways, do I need to roll with
[[Rapport]] or just talk in character? Does it matter that I have a high
[[Rapport]] if all that's required is for me to roleplay what my character
says?

When Brendan Conway and I worked on the new [[Fate Core]] update for
_Bulldogs!_ by Galileo Games, we ran into this problem around haggling
over prices. We wanted our players to have fun roleplaying out the back
and forth of negotiations, but we also wanted the Haggling skill to
matter.

In this article, I explain the new system we developed for
_**negotiations**_ in [[Fate Core]], a special system for haggling over
costs. Like other lenses for action in Fate---challenges, contests, and
conflicts---negotiations work between two PCs or between a PC and an
NPC, with any number of assisting characters on either side, helping to
structure a series of rolls that encourage players to think
strategically about the negotiation while roleplaying out their
positions.

## Negotiations: The Basics

Like challenges, contests, and conflicts, a negotiation sets up a
procedure for handling rolls. Note that a negotiation isn't a challenge,
contest, or conflict; those lenses for action are already described in
[[Fate Core]] System (pages 146-175) and cover situations where characters
are solving problems, competing for resources, and trying to harm each
other.

Negotiation, on the other hand, is about trying to come to a deal. It's
not just about convincing the other side that they should buy your
products; it's also about pressuring them to take a price you like
without revealing how much you want the deal to get done in the first
place. Negotiations focus on strengths and weaknesses of a position, in
addition to the actual act of convincing, threatening, or tricking
someone into taking the deal.

> investigating, leaving Justin and Marissa's characters outside the

> this will be a negotiation!

Here's how it works:

- Set the stakes for the negotiation
- Select lead negotiators
- Create advantages
- Make a final roll

### Phase 1: Set the Stakes for the Negotiation

The first step of any negotiation is to agree on the stakes. In
_Bulldogs!_, most purchases have a standard cost, but most systems (and
situations) don't have such an easy blueprint for outcomes. Before any
dice hit the table, both sides have to agree on what will happen if
either side succeeds or succeeds with style.

To start, both sides should declare a minimum outcome, whatever it is
they think would happen if they "won" the negotiation---remember that
this is a negotiation, not a social conflict, so winning can't be
something the other side would never tolerate. After those bare minimum
successes are detailed, each side should also put forward their version
of a full victory, what it looks like if the other side mostly concedes
in taking the deal.

> than one hostage! Brendan nods, and asks if one hostage would be
> acceptable. The players agree to that, but only if it's not one of
> them.
>
> Together, they list out the outcomes:
>
> **PC Success:** The robbers release Isaac's character, but the robbers
> still have hostages.
>
> **PC Success with Style:** The robbers release all the hostages and
> surrender.
>
> **Robber Success:** The PCs provide the robbers with a getaway vehicle
> and ensure their safe passage.
>
> **Robber Success with Style:** The robbers get to take one NPC hostage
> with them.
>
> Marissa, Justin, and Isaac agree to those terms---they could live with
> the robbers getting away with one hostage, and getting Isaac out means
> that they can put together a plan to free the rest of the hostages!### Ties in Negotiations

Ties in negotiations can mean two things:

- A twist---as would happen in a contest
- The deal falls apart, and the PCs have to find a new way forward

In the event of a tie, the GM chooses which one is more appropriate for
the situation at hand.### Phase 2: Select Lead Negotiators

Once the stakes are set, both sides select a lead negotiator. Since the
lead negotiator will make the final negotiations roll, it's ideal for
both sides to select someone with a high [[Rapport]] (or whatever skill
makes sense in your setting). At the same time, both sides also want a
lead negotiator who has a high resistance skill as well, since they'll
also have to defend against any advantages the other side tries to
create!

> The PCs quickly select Justin's character as their lead negotiator:
> he's got a Good (+3) [[Rapport]] and a Fair (+2) [[Will]]. He's not the best
> negotiator in the FBI, but he's the best they've got on the scene.
>
> Brendan selects Michelle, one of the bank robbers, as the opposing
> lead negotiator: she's got a Great (+4) [[Rapport]] and a Good (+3) [[Will]].
> The PCs will need to work hard to get her to back down and release the
> hostages.

### Phase 3: Create Advantages

Now for the fun part: each character involved in the
conflict---including the lead negotiators--- gets to make one create
advantage roll to influence the negotiation. These rolls are based on
whatever fictional positioning makes sense for the action the character
takes---for example, pointing a gun at someone might let them create an
advantage with [[Shoot]]. The lead negotiator can then use the free invokes
generated by these rolls on the final [[Rapport]] roll.### The First to Act?

It's usually clear who should start talking in a negotiation first, but
if there's any disagreement, use [[Empathy]] to determine who is first to
act. A negotiation is a kind of social conflict, and those who have the
emotional sensitivity to know when to talk can press the advantage.
After that, you can use popcorn initiative (each player chooses who goes
next) or go in order of descending [[Empathy]].The opposing lead negotiator resists these attempts to create
advantages---usually with [[Will]]---with the hope of turning them around so
they create free invokes for the opposition. Sometimes in [[Fate Core]], a
failure to [[Create Advantage]] results in nothing happening; in a
negotiation, it _always_ leads to the opposition getting free invokes on
new aspects. If one character starts waving a gun, for example, with a
successful defense the opposition might create the aspect [More Guns
than You] (with a free invoke) to remind the other side that
they have weapons as well.

> sure you're not bad people. There's no need for violence. I'm sure we
> all want to get out of this alive." He succeeds against Michelle's
> [[Will]] by a single [[shift]]---enough to create [No One Needs to Get
> Hurt] with one free invoke.

> every hostage in this place is dead, even your friend. You know that,

> against Michelle's [[Will]], earning an aspect---[In Over Your
> Heads] with two free invokes.
>

> gets [We Still Have Guns] with one free invoke.### Who gets to help?

During the [[Create Advantage]] phase, characters can only lend a +1 to a
roll if they aren't creating an advantage themselves. They can still,
however, spend [[fate point]]s to increase someone's roll if they can invoke
an appropriate aspect. Mobs, who usually have very low rolls, are
usually best suited to supporting one NPC instead of trying to create
advantages on their own.### Phase 4: Make a Final Roll

Once the [[Create Advantage]] phase is over, the two lead negotiators make
an opposed [[Rapport]] roll to determine the outcome of the negotiation,
making use of their free invokes. The negotiation is over after this
single roll---no repeats---and both sides are bound by the stakes of the
negotiation.

> Justin rolls ++0- for a total of +4 before adding in any invokes; all
> the PCs are out of [[fate point]]s, so they've got to hope their free
> invokes are enough. Brendan---rolling for Michelle---rolls +++0 for a
> total of +7, and immediately uses her two free invokes to bring the
> total up to +11. Justin uses his three free invokes to get up to a
> +10, but it's not quite enough. The robbers win the negotiation, and
> the PCs are forced to help them get an escape vehicle provided they
> leave the hostages behind.
>
> Of course, the mystery is just getting started...

## Using Negotiations in Play

Negotiations are a great way to create drama and tension in scenes
instead of throwing down into a full conflict or focusing on overcome
actions through challenges. We hope you find a use for these at your
table!
