It didn't used to be called Silicon City. Long ago, before the national
government collapsed, before they built the wall that cut the City off
from the desert, before the War, it had a different name. That's all
lost to memory. Now it's just Silicon City---gleaming and
perfect---rising from the shoreline like a monument to humanity's reach
for the stars. It's the Shifting City, Code City, a flash of zeroes and
ones that never sits still, not for a moment. It's our destiny.### Quick Start Adventures

Silicon City is a Quick Start Adventure that contains a unique setting,
pregenerated characters, plot hooks, and an opening scene. It's not a
full adventure, but it will get your group started on a brand new Fate
campaign!### The Council

Silicon City still has a functioning government, but power in the City
is centralized in the Council, the "elected" representatives of the
seventeen districts that make up Silicon City. Councilmembers are powers
unto themselves, oligarchs and virtual warlords who rule over the City
in luxury, meeting only to decide the fate of the citizens. They are
absolute, and the elections that put them in power are usually puppet
shows designed to placate the masses.

### The Archons

To keep the City safe from the rapidly multiplying technological and
political threats, the Council appoints Archons to keep the peace.
Archons are the best and brightest that the City has to offer, law
enforcement prodigies who have sworn to give their lives to keep the
City intact and the Council in power. They are soldiers and detectives,
clever and deadly all at once.

The Council has granted the Archons a broad set of extrajudicial powers:
Archons can go anywhere, look at anything, ask any question, and destroy
any target... provided they're willing to answer to the Council after
the job is done. This is not an idle threat. Archons have found
themselves stripped of their status and relegated to the salt wastes
south of the City for acting beyond the Council's authority.

Archons generally act with cautious impunity. They have the authority to
override and commandeer any resources they need to protect the City, but
they realize that it's dangerous to think you've got it all figured out.
Situations evolve rapidly, and smart Archons avoid jumping into danger
until the odds are in their favor. That said, they're proactive,
competent enforcers of law and order, and many of them have sacrificed
their lives to keep terrorists and criminals from destroying Silicon
City.

### Syndicates, Corporations, and Cartels

Despite its best efforts, the Council's power in Silicon City is not
absolute. Syndicates, corporations, and cartels---legal and
illegal---hold sway over much of the City's populace. The crime
syndicates are the most vicious, but they tend to stay out of the actual
politics of the City. Corporations muck around in the public eye, all
but immune to legal proceedings, but they remain wary of the power of
Archons who have an eye for actual justice. Cartels are the lowest
organizations, but the hardest to stamp out or run out of business.
Archons know that they wear a target on their backs if they look too
closely at an organization without pulling the trigger.

### The Undercity

Deep below the glitz and glamour of Silicon City, the poor and the
restless find shelter. There's not enough room in the upper floors of
the sweeping skyscrapers for everyone, of course, and those that haven't
been able to work their way to a better life find themselves condemned
to the Undercity, a dense and labyrinthine network of tunnels and old
buildings that plays host to a shadow city just beyond the Archon's
reach. Rumor has it there's a revolution brewing down there...### Are Archons the Bad Guys?

A few Archons abuse their power, muscling in on various criminal
enterprises and working for syndicates, but most Archons want to see the
City succeed. Archons aren't saints, but neither are they only looking
out for themselves. There are easier ways to get ahead in Silicon City!
Archons are a system, a way of keeping order in the chaotic and
semi-lawless City---the people called to do that work believe in that
system.## Setting Creation

As a Quick Start Adventure, _**Silicon City**_ has everything you need
to jump right into your first session. Before you start, you'll want to
discuss the broader setting with your group. Silicon City faces one
immediate issue---a spike in the abuse of Hydra, a designer drug---and
two additional issues bubbling under the surface, ready to erupt at any
moment.

At the start of play, explain the **current issue** to your players and
ask them to fill in one or two additional faces associated with the
[Hydra Epidemic]. These additional characters will provide new
plot hooks and twists that will tie your players to the thorny problem
afoot.

Then ask your players to choose from one of the two available impending
issues: [Robot Civil Rights] or [Silicon City
Elections]. Have them fill in one or two additional faces for
their chosen impending issue as well, rounding out the larger cast of
characters with their suggestions.

### Current Issue: Hydra Epidemic

Of course, no shining city on a hill is without its problems. Archons
all over Silicon City are reporting a serious uptick in Hydra usage, the
designer drug of choice among the wealthy and elite. The [Hydra
Epidemic] is a serious concern for the Council, so it's on the
radar of every Archon in the City. Fearing an outbreak of violence and
chaos, the Council has ordered the Archons to do everything they can to
bring the epidemic to a close.

Hydra is an especially dangerous drug because citizens who enjoy great
privileges in Silicon City are the primary users. Initial doses of the
drug speed up cognition and human processing, making it a perfect fit
for financial wizards and high-priced code junkies. But as the drug
takes hold in the nervous system, some users display psychopathic
outbreaks of violence. It's not unusual for a long-term user---a
Hydradrone---to murder a business partner on a whim or abduct a stranger
without warning. The only ominous hint of an imminent crime is the thin
black veins that spread across the eyes of Hydradrones, the telltale
marks that give the drug its name.

**Faces:**

- Drazick, major supplier of Hydra in Silicon City District 3
- Frances Nguyen, scientist working on a cure for Hydradrone
  psychopathy

### Impending Issues

In addition to the [Hydra Epidemic] plaguing the City, there
are a number of other impending issues that the Council is concerned
might erupt into larger conflicts, including:

#### Robot Civil Rights

Artificial intelligence in Silicon City has been advancing at a nearly
exponential rate. Despite their impressive intellectual and social
gains, robots within the City are treated as property. There are no laws
against destroying a robot you own, for example, and any violence
against robots is considered to be property damage instead of assault or
murder.

A number of robot activists and allies within Silicon City hope to
change the public's perception of robot civil rights. As robots have
gained additional cognitive capacity, many within the City are starting
to believe that robots may effectively be people, with all the rights
and responsibilities thus included. At the same time, paramilitary
groups like the Humanists hold a fundamentally opposed position, arguing
that no robot can possibly be equal to a human being.

**Faces:**

- Alexandria 7, android leader in the Robot Civil Rights movement
- Carol Xibua, Humanist spokesperson and anti-robot activist

#### Silicon City Elections

Corporations in Silicon City exert control over most facets of the daily
lives of citizens, but the City is still ostensibly a democracy. Archons
are allowed to pursue fugitives regardless of jurisdiction, use lethal
force, and commandeer resources precisely because the Council is
selected by the will of the people. For Silicon City's political elite,
elections are a necessary evil that enables the continued functioning of
the City's many services.

This election season, a new candidate---Millan Tratar---appears to be
mobilizing many of the City's poorer citizens in District 3. The
incumbent in that district has held the seat for some time, but a number
of fiscal scandals have left him vulnerable to the upstart.
Disturbingly, Tratar is promising to dismantle the Archon system itself,
claiming that the extrajudicial powers granted to Archons are "a tool of
the oppressors." She enjoys widespread support.

**Faces:**

- Marshall St. John, pro-Archon incumbent councilor for District 3
- Aliyah Carter, political director for Millan
  Tratar![[index-cards-4.png]]

## Character Creation

_**Silicon City**_ works well with either [[Fate Core]] or Fate Accelerated
characters. _**Silicon City**_ characters complete only two phases in
the phase trio, selecting a **tech aspect** instead of the third phase
aspect. In addition, players building [[Fate Core]] characters can make use
of Hack, the new skill presented with this adventure.

Usually players take on the role of Archons, extrajudicial forces of the
Silicon City Council, and the adventure assumes this is the case. It's
not an absolute requirement, of course, and the setting works with
civilian or support characters.### Pregenerated Characters

If your players wish to play pregenerated Archons, you can use the three
sample characters provided in this adventure. Stats are provided for
both [[Fate Core]] and Fate Accelerated versions of each character.

## New Skill: Hack

Hack is the skill you use to penetrate, disarm, and rejigger computer
code found on networked devices. In settings with networked electronics,
Hack represents your ability to alter the code that runs the world.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Hack allows you to bypass all sorts of electronic
obstacles including digital locks, encrypted files, or difficult robots.
You can even use Hack to disarm or shut down physical electronics that
are hooked up to digital networks.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: You can use Hack to create any number of
digital advantages, including [Forged Identification
Credentials] or [False Sensor Readings]. In short, you
can make things go wrong, often without leaving any trace. You can also
use Hack to set up preemptive defenses against hackers (like placing
[Encrypted File Locks] on sensitive files).

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Hack is used to make mental attacks against electronic
systems that have preprogrammed defenses or codelocks. It can also be
used to attack other characters if you find yourself facing off against
a rival hacker in a virtual environment.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: You can't defend with Hack. You need [[Will]] to fight off
attacks in a virtual environment from rival hackers or activated
security systems.

### Hack Stunts

**Extended Access.** When you succeed with style on a create advantage
roll using Hack, you may immediately create a second aspect with a free
invoke as your programming subroutines locate additional information.

**It's All in the Code.** Use Hack instead of [[Empathy]] when you tear
apart a piece of code to discover aspects about the code's programmer.

### Overcome vs. Attack with Hack

As a rule of thumb, you can only attack things that have stress tracks.
If an electronic obstacle doesn't have a way of absorbing stress, you
only need an overcome action to get past it using Hack.### Tech Aspects

Tech aspects give _**Silicon City**_ characters an opportunity to make
use of advanced technology such as cybernetic implants, prosthetic
limbs, or more traditional guns and armor. The right tech can mean the
difference between life or death when you're facing down Hydra runners
or anti-robot terrorists.

Example Tech Aspects: [Cybernetic Head Jack], [Spider Claw
Gloves], [DNA Scrambler], [Optical Enhancers]

## Opening Scene: Raid on Asombra Arcology

Recent activity in the drug markets have tipped the Council off to the
whereabouts of Drazick, one of the major suppliers of Hydra in Silicon
City. According to undercover sources, Drazick has been hiding out in
the abandoned Asombra Arcology, a planned community on a small island
west of the City itself. Asombra was declared a "nonlivable zone" by the
Council after it was discovered that the developers used unstable
duracrete in the construction of the 120-story facility.

As the scene opens, the player characters are in a helojet headed to
Asombra. They have a number of additional Council forces, but they're
the only Archons assigned to bring Drazick in to face the Council. They
need to land on the shores of the island, fight their way to the doors
of the Arcology, and find their way to wherever Drazick is hiding before
he has a chance to escape.

### The Opposition at Asombra

Drazick's crew has a few goons, one more serious enforcer, and Drazick
himself. If you've got a big group of player characters, consider adding
more goons inside the Arcology and perhaps even statting up another
bodyguard for Drazick. This conflict should take most of your first
session.

The scene should start with an action order as the conflict gets
underway. Provide your players with a set of zones for the beach and
Asombra Arcology and a set of opening aspects with one free invoke each.

Opening Aspects: [Pounding Rain], [Unstable
Duracrete], [Asombra Squatters]

In the unlikely event that Drazick has the option of bailing on his crew
to get away, he'll take it. They were all hired to be expendable anyway.### Skill Modes?

Silicon City uses skill modes for NPCs instead of individual skills.
When NPCs take action in accordance with that general activity, they get
the skill rating of the mode. If no skill mode is appropriate, the NPC
rolls on a +0. These NPCs can also gang up and assist each other---four
of Drazick's goons will get a +6 (+3 for skill mode and +3 for ganging
up) when shooting at Archons.

## Drazick's Goons (8)

Drazick's not some low-level thug. His men are highly trained and
equipped with military-grade equipment. Worse yet, someone has tipped
Drazick off to the Archon raid that's coming at him. His goons are
prepared to return fire on Council forces and stand their ground to give
Drazick time to prepare his defenses.

### Aspects

[Armed Cartel Enforcers] • [Smarter Than They Look] •
[Ready for Archons]

### Skills

Good (+3) Shooting at Council Forces, Standing Ground

Poor (--1) Running Away, Sneaking Around

### Stress

## Grafton White

As Drazick climbed his way up the cartel ladder, Grafton White was happy
to provide the muscle needed to knock down his opponents. A hulking man
with tattoos and piercings, Grafton is the perfect enforcer to
intimidate, frighten, and crush Drazick's opposition.

### Aspects

[Trusted Right-Hand Man] • [Tattooed Muscleman] •
[Deadly with a Knife]

### Skills

**Poisoned Blade.** When you succeed with style on an attack with a
knife, spend a [[fate point]] to inflict the mild consequence Poisoned on
your target.

### Stress

□□□□

### Consequences

Mild (2) • Moderate (4)

## Drazick

Drazick isn't just a drug lord---he's the inventor of Hydra itself. The
Council has information that leads them to believe that he might know
how to counteract the side effects of the drug, making it the perfect
tool for them to distribute to Archons and Council staff. Drazick,
however, isn't exactly eager to turn over his secrets, and he'll do
everything in his power to keep from being captured.

### Aspects

[Hydra Drug Lord] • [Master Chemist] • [Nasty
Limp]

### Skills

Superb (+5) Making Hydra
Good (+3) Shooting at Archons, Resisting Questioning
Average (+1) Setting Traps, Planning Ambushes
Poor (--1) Running Away

### Stunts

**Slippery.** In the event that someone tries to create an advantage
that would keep you from leaving a zone or scene, spend a [[fate point]] to
turn that [[situation aspect]] into a boost.

### Stress

□□□

### Consequences

Mild (2) • Moderate (4) • Major (6)## Plot Hooks and Adventure Seeds

The opening scene of _**Silicon City**_ isn't the end of the adventure.
The players may have captured Drazick, but he's certainly not the only
Hydra supplier in town. And don't forget the impending issues! Here are
a few plot hooks and adventure seeds to keep the story going, varying
the tone and pace of scenes after the conflict at Asombra:

### Drazik Trades Up

Drazick isn't a martyr or a fool. If the players captured him, he'll try
to strike a deal to keep himself safe at the expense of the people who
funded his initial Hydra research. (Even if the Archons didn't capture
Drazick, he might come forward with a deal now that his organization is
in trouble!) He claims that he can get the Archons access to La Araña (The Spider), the woman who funded a number of designer drugs, including
Hydra. Since the Council knows little about the internal dealings of the
cartels, they aren't even really sure that La Araña exists. Does Drazick
really know who La Araña is or is he setting the Archons up for a trap?

### Humanist attack at Robot Protest

If your players chose [Robot Civil Rights] as their impending
issue, give the Archons an alert that surveillance drones have picked up
Humanist traffic regarding a terrorist attack on pro-robot protestors
near Silicon City Plaza #24. Alexandria 7 is scheduled to give a speech
outlining her vision for robot civil liberties---she's a high-profile
target that could potentially attract Humanist assassins---but the crowd
of human and robot supporters is just as likely to be targeted by the
anti-robot forces. Can the Archons find the terrorists and stop the
strike or will they be left dealing with the chaos caused by the
Humanists?

### Carter Asks For Help

If your players chose [Silicon City Elections] as their
impending issue, Aliyah Carter comes to Silicon City HQ to talk to the
Archons directly. Millan Tratar---the challenger in the District 3
elections who claims the Archons are "tools of the oppressor"---is
missing. The candidate is fond of walking the neighborhoods in the south
of District 3 alone, but Tratar didn't return from her excursion the
previous night. Carter isn't sure who else to turn to for help. Did
someone associated with Councilman St. John kidnap Tratar to ensure that
the upstart campaign would fail or is Tratar not as squeaky clean as she
appears? +## Sample Characters for [[Fate Core]]

## Adam Brennan

Less than a year ago, Adam Brennan was an average cop working in
District 15, pursuing everyday thugs and criminals in a tough part of
the City. That all changed when a Humanist bomb at a robot justice
center left him nearly dead. Now he's been rebuilt with state-of-the-art
Council technology as a cyborg, a new breed of Archon built to protect
the City from all of its enemies. Nearly 65% of his body is mechanical
now, leading many to question if he's even human anymore. Brennan
dismisses such questions, but is starting to wonder which side of "the
Robot Question" he's really on.

### Aspects

**High Concept:** [Experimental Cyborg Prototype]
**Trouble:** [Councilman St. John's Nephew]
**Tech Aspect:** [Industructible][ Duraskin]

Average (+1) [[Athletics]], [[Contacts]], [[Notice]], [[Rapport]]

### Stunts

**Extended Access.** When you succeed with style on a create advantage
roll using Hack, you may immediately create a second aspect with a free
invoke as your programming subroutines locate additional information.

**Part Man, Part Machine, All Cop.** +2 to [[Overcome]] actions with
[[Athletics]] if you are pursuing a subject to make an arrest.

**Hardwired Sensors.** You may use [[Fight]] instead of [[Notice]] to detect
surprise attacks or ambushes.

### Stress

## Harvey Gatten

If there was a time before Archons, Harvey Gatten would remember it.
He's the oldest Archon working for the council, an old man whose wits
and experience carry him through situations that would kill a lesser
man. He's short for an Archon, but faster than you might think. His long
white hair stands in sharp contrast to his darker skin, framing a face
that's weathered and wrinkled, but somehow just as lively as ever. He
should have retired by now, but everyone knows retirement never ends
well for Archons---they have too many enemies to go quietly into the
night.

### Aspects

**High Concept:** [Grizzled Veteran]
**Trouble:** [Ex-Family Man]
**Tech Aspect:** [Single Action Peacemaker]
[One Foot Out the Door] • [By the Book]

### Skills

Great (+4) [[Investigate]]
Good (+3) [[Contacts]], [[Shoot]]
Fair (+2) [[Provoke]], [[Stealth]], [[Will]]
Average (+1) [[Burglary]], [[Deceive]], [[Notice]], [[Rapport]]

### Stunts

**Investigator's Eye.** You can use [[Investigate]] instead of [[Empathy]] to
learn the aspects of a target through careful observation and
questioning. You need at least five minutes of sustained interaction.

**Freeze!** +2 to [[Provoke]] when you are trying to intimidate nameless
NPCs into surrendering. You may also spend a [[fate point]] to target a
group of nameless NPCs simultaneously with a [[Provoke]] attack.

**Oldtimer.** Once per session, you can spend a [[fate point]] to establish
that a named NPC has the aspect Old Friend. You get an additional free
invoke on any advantages you create on that NPC until the end of the
session.

## Brooke Towers

Brooke Towers is a ghost, an enigma, a dark-haired, intense woman who
ends up where she's needed as if by magic. The truth is that she learned
her skills from a syndicate---she's exactly the kind of criminal that
Archons normally hunt. When her syndicate left her for dead in the
Undercity, she found her way to the Council, offering her services to
the powers-that-be. But Towers is terrified that the things she did in
the Undercity, and the _bruja_ curse she's convinced she picked up, will
end her life before she can turn it around.

### Aspects

**High Concept:** [Ex-Syndicate Operative]
**Trouble:** [Cursed by an Undercity Bruja]
**Tech Aspect:** [Cybernetic Leg]
[Team Player] • [Does the Dirty Work]

### Skills

Good (+3) [[Provoke]], [[Will]]
Fair (+2) [[Deceive]], [[Physique]], [[Stealth]]
Average (+1) [[Drive]], [[Empathy]], [[Fight]], [[Shoot]]

### Stunts

**Get the Drop.** Spend a [[fate point]] to move to any zone in a scene
instead of taking an action during a conflict.

**Called Shot.** During a [[Shoot]] attack, spend a [[fate point]] and declare a
specific condition you want to inflict on a target, like Shot in the
Hand. If you succeed, you place that as a [[situation aspect]] on the target
in addition to inflicting stress.

**Ice Cold.** +2 to defending with [[Will]] against attacks designed to
intimidate or scare you.

**True Friend.** Once per session, you can add your [[Will]] to an ally's
defense against a mental attack by standing with the ally against a
common opponent.
