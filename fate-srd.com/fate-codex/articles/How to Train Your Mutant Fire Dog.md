# How to Train Your Mutant Fire Dog: Monster Training in Fate Accelerated

Monster training is a popular genre. From Pokémon and Medabots to
Digimon and Shaman King, monster trainers get around. In this article
I'll show you a way to drop player-directed monsters into your ongoing
campaigns, how to give them life, and how to improve their abilities
over time.

## Monsters as Extras

Monsters are powerful, probably far more powerful than your player
characters. That's okay because monsters are here to lend power to
their trainers.

To make this power more real we're going to create the monster as an
extra ([[Fate Core]], page 207) to attach to your PCs. While you won't find
extras discussed in Fate Accelerated Edition, anything from [[Fate Core]]
can easily be tweaked to suit your FAE game. We'll take basic Fate
Accelerated building blocks of aspects, stress, stunts, etc. and make
something new with them.

Monsters are simple for players and GMs to create. Wild monsters and
monsters commanded by NPC trainers can be written up as mooks or
characters in their own right. Once they're in the hands of PCs, though,
they're written out like this:

### Name

Name your monster anything you like. A nickname, a code name, or
whatever happens to come out of the monster's mouth.

### Stage

Monsters are divided into stages that outline how powerful they are.
There are 3 stages in all. To ascend through the stages you need to gain
XP (we'll get back to this a little later).

### Aspect

Each monster gets their own aspect detailing three things: a core
personality trait, an element that they embody, and a real-world animal
or object that they resemble.

### Stress

A monster has three stress boxes, just like their trainer.

### Consequences

A monster's consequences depend on their stage. Stage one monsters have
one mild consequence slot, stage two monsters add on a moderate
consequence slot, and stage three monsters get a severe consequence
slot.

### Stunts

A monster gets one stunt at stage one, and one more each time it ascends
to a higher stage.

### XP track

Each monster has an XP track with a number of boxes to fill. Stage one
monsters have five boxes, stage two monsters have six boxes, and stage
three monsters have seven boxes.

### Approaches

Monsters don't have their own approaches. They're only as good as their
trainer and therefore depend on their trainer's approaches.## Zipp

Stage One.

### Aspect

Monster Concept: [Loyal Fire Dog]

### Stunts

Heart of Fire. Because I have fire in my heart, I get a free invoke on
the first consequence that my trainer or I take in a conflict.

### Stress

□□□

### Consequences

Mild (2)

### XP

□□□□□## Monsters in Play

Monsters can do things that their trainers can't. Throwing fire around
like it's a play thing is an example of this, but so is tracking by
scent.

> Zipp is a dog made of fire. By his nature, he can do all that implies,
> such as throw fireballs with his mouth, listen closely with his ears,
> or bite with his teeth.

PC monsters act on behalf of their trainer. Whenever a PC could take an
action, they can use their monster instead, as long as it makes sense in
the situation. Monsters don't get separate turns---when they act, they
take up their trainer's turn. You're basically substituting your
monster for yourself. Perhaps you join in the fray and act together with
your monster, but this is primarily narrative---either way, you get one
action per turn between you and your monster.

> The giant spider is closing in fast. Kairi orders Zipp to protect them
> with a spray of fire to force the bigger monster back. Kairi's player
> rolls her Forceful approach and succeeds on her defense. The spider's
> attack is stopped in its tracks.

If you fail a defense action then you can choose which of you takes the
stress or consequences.

> Let's say that Kairi and Zipp failed that last defense action. The
> spider inflicts 2 stress on Kairi and Zipp. However, instead of
> letting Zipp take stress, Kairi's player decides to soak up the stress
> with a mild consequence, [Shaken]. The spider is driven back
> by the fire, but Kairi is affected by the close call.

When a monster attempts to **overcome an obstacle** or **create an
advantage** and the GM needs to set a target number, keep in mind the
kind of monster it is and the aspects that could be working against it.
Think about adjusting the difficulty for the action, perhaps by adding a
+1 for every aspect working against it and +2 for aspects with elemental
details that trump the monster's element.

> Kairi and Zipp are trying to escape a collapsing tunnel. As they flee,
> water is trickling down from the roof and is about to crash into the
> tunnel along with some very big rocks.
>
> The players at the table decided earlier that fire elementals don't do
> fantastically against rock, so the GM decides that the difficulty
> would usually be Good (+3) for the collapsing tunnel. However, that
> [Impending Flood] is awfully intimidating to Zipp, which adds
> a +2 to the difficulty just for having the watery aspect present in
> the scene and making trouble for Zipp. So Zipp needs to get at least a
> Superb (+5) to make good on this escape.
>
> If an NPC invoked such an aspect in a conflict, they'd award fate
> points to Zipp, but this sort of passive difficulty adjustment does
> not.

Monsters are also empathic toward their trainers. Any consequences that
the trainer has will worry a monster. Consequences and other aspects on
a trainer can be the basis for a compel on the monster's behavior. Any
compels on the monster's behavior award [[fate point]]s to their trainer.

## XP

And now, as promised, we'll discuss XP. You might be scratching your
head. "But June," you say, "there are no experience points in FAE!"

Well, now there are, although they don't work the way XP usually does.
In _**How to Train Your Mutant Fire Dog**_, a monster moves on to the
next stage in a time of crisis or uncertainty. To model this I've added
another resource to the game: XP. Once you fill up the required amount
of XP, your monster develops new abilities and maybe even changes shape.

To gain XP:

- Your character must be involved in a conflict.

- Your monster must participate in that conflict.

- Your character or your monster must take a consequence in the
  conflict.

- In the end, you must concede the conflict.

Conflicts where you win don't count. When you concede a conflict, you
gain an XP and fill in a box on your monster's XP track. Once all the
boxes are filled, your monster ascends to the next stage.

When your monster moves up a level, you do the following:

- Add a stunt to your monster.

- Redefine your monster's stunts (optional).

- Add the next level consequence slot to your monster.

- Redefine or add a part to your monster's aspect (optional).

This little sub-system rounds out the monster training experience,
but....

## There Are Still Spaces to Explore with This

Maybe you can catch and tame new monsters in your game. Perhaps the GM
plays the monsters, or the players each play another PC's monster. Or
maybe you just want to drop the monster mechanics into a game about a
magical school to give extra flair to familiars. There are a thousand
different ways to train your mutant fire dog.
