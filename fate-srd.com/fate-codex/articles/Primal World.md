## The Chaos Worlds

Infinite different realities dot the multiverse. Spheres, or cosms, or
planes, or whatever you choose to call them. Some old, on the brink of
dying, like the world containing the Crater Basin and Anglekite. Some
middle-aged, with plenty of trials ahead of them before their time is
up, like the sphere that Varkith calls home. Some past the edge of their
own demise, waiting to be destroyed or recycled, like the cosm known as
Lastlife. And some, brand new, still trying to form themselves into
concrete reality. Being wiped away before they can assert their own
reality is the greatest threat to their existence.### The Last Days of Anglekite and Beyond

_Primal World_ is a part of the same fictional set-up as **The Last Days
of Anglekite**, the Dungeon World setting Kickstarted by Magpie Games in
February of 2015. While The Last Days of Anglekite and the other Chaos
World settings from the Kickstarter, **The Cold Ruins of Lastlife** and
**The Green Law of Varkith**, are all written up with the Dungeon World
system, they still tie together with Primal World as individual versions
of Chaos Worlds. If you'd like to know more about Chaos Worlds, and
about Anglekite, Lastlife, or Varkith, then head to
<http://magpiegames.com/chaos-worlds>.### The Untamed Neocosm

This primal world is such a sphere, a place of neonate essence, to be
explored, discovered, and made solid through that discovery. There is no
history here, no tradition, no rules from past generations. There is
only the limitless potential for anything to be created, to be found.
And in a world so young, the choices of its inhabitants will reshape it
even as they explore it. Such adventurers show the world how to be, even
as the world shapes those born to it.

### The Nascent Pillars of Creation

Even a world as young as this has the beginnings of its structure
forming. Critical points, places of order or being, strong
notions---these are the first crystallizations of the world's essence.

#### The Origin

The Origin is the single most structured and solidified point in the
world's existence, and its form speaks to the world's underlying nature.
Changing the Origin would alter that nature. Destroying the Origin would
destabilize the world into non-existence.

Finding out exactly what the Origin is, its form, its purpose, is the
first discovery for those exploring and defining the primal world.

#### The Calling

The Calling is some metaphysical sensation that drives the world's most
adventurous denizens together. The Calling is why some explore,
investigate, and uncover the nature of this primal world, solidifying it
further. It is the survival instinct of the primal world expressing
itself through an unconscious drive in the souls of these beings.

#### The Carnivore

Ideas coalesce and form into new shards of existence in any forming
world. Some ideas are kind and gentle, some beautiful and stunning,
others lethal and dangerous. There is no telling what wonders await the
nascent world. In this case, the primal world's inchoate form gave birth
to something terrifying: the Carnivore.

The Carnivore is an enormous beast, thirty feet tall, with a maw filled
with row after row of teeth---no two alike. Every possible fang fills
its snaggle-toothed misshapen mouth. Its six eyes can see in the dark,
can see heat, can see prey in any possible way. Its body is covered in
armored plating like an armadillo, its eight limbs thick and powerful,
tipped with rending claws or strong, bone-cracking fingers. It
represents the hunger for flesh, consumption, predation. The Carnivore
is the world consuming itself; every creature devoured is a bit of the
world lost to its own hunger.

And of course, that self-destructive impulse leads the Carnivore to hunt
those who would solidify the world.

## Setting Creation

As a Quick Start Adventure, Primal World has everything you need to jump
into a weird fantasy Fate game.

Much of Primal World is about defining the setting through play, both by
discovering it and by shaping it yourself. As a result, you won't be
defining that much of the world before you get started. You'll only need
to know some of the basics, including:

- The Origin: where you are starting your adventures from.
- The Calling: why you are adventuring together.
- The Issues: what the most prominent known threats are---the Current
  Issue, and the Impending Issue.

The rest comes from your characters, and from discovery!

### The Origin

The Origin is your primal world's first real location, where your
characters have come together and from whence they will venture forth.

To define your world's Origin, choose three aspects. These aspects are
in play whenever dealing directly with the Origin.

- Form: how the Origin looks. Is it a crystal palace, or an
  underground city grown from living rock?
- Function: the Origin's purpose and how that defines the world. Is it
  a massive library for recording all knowledge? A locked up armory of
  terrible weaponry?
- Face: the being in charge of the Origin, who came into being with
  the Origin itself. Is it a regent, ruling over the Origin? Or a
  caretaker, self-charged with ensuring the Origin's safety?

**Sample Origin**

**Form:** [The Infinite Obsidian Tower], a massive obsidian
tower extending as far as the eye can see.

**Function:** [A Nexus of Doorways Throughout the World]; the
Obsidian Tower has an infinite number of doors, which open up gateways
to other unformed part of the world.

**Face:** [The Silent Keylord], a robed and masked figure with
an endless supply of keys, each opening a single door.

When defining your Origin, think of the strange, the unique, and the
weird. Even though the world is brand new, that doesn't mean there can't
be incredibly peculiar, oddly eternal elements throughout it.

### The Calling

The Calling is why characters have come together, their uniting purpose.
All characters share the same Calling. If you want to jump into play
quickly, use the following calling: [Discover and Solidify the
World].

If you have time to choose a Calling, pick any of the following options:

- [Discover and Solidify the World]
- [Defend the World from Externals]
- [Shape the New World in Your Image]
- [Create a New Society]
- [Nurture the World's Growth]

Talk about the Calling and what it means to you. Remember that it is a
metaphysical urge bringing the heroes together, not anything tangible.

### The Issues

The Issues are the threats that are either currently dangerous or
growing in danger.

Explain and talk about the **current issue**, which by default is _The
Carnivore_. Have the players name at least two faces for the current
issue, or use the two provided faces.

Look at the characters' Calling and think about what issues would best
threaten it. If the Calling is "Discover and Solidify the World," think
about possible barriers against such discovery. If the Calling is
"Defend the World from Externals," think about what externals most
threaten the world. These will help you craft your impending issues
appropriately.

#### Current Issue: The Origin Devoured

Everything in a primal world is a first, the original form of an idea.
The Carnivore is the first creature defined by its need to consume: a
predator, the embodiment of predation. The Carnivore's approach
threatens the new beings of this world---each one it consumes is an
essence lost, given over to the Carnivore. But destroying the Carnivore
would also rob the world of a piece of its essence. Slaying the beast is
one option...but the costs must be carefully considered.

Faces:

- The Carnivore. Powerful, hungry, and dangerously intelligent,
  indifferent to the essence of the world and the cost of destroying
  whatever it consumes.
- Songbird, an avian creature and sole source of music, whose home
  lies in the path of the Carnivore's rampage toward the
  Origin.![](https://image/index-cards-1.html)

### Impending Issues

To craft your impending issues, look at the characters' Calling and
establish a major threat with at least two faces that stands in the way.
Here's a simple set of possible issues and faces based on the Callings
above:

[Discover and Solidify the World]

The Secretist, a creature defined by its desire to seek and keep
secrets, aims to prevent any discoveries of the world's deeper truths.

[Defend the World from Externals]

Phthogyrak, the Eye of Plague, is a monstrous floating eye surrounded by
a haze of black corruption, attempting to infect the world with its own
consciousness.

[Shape the New World in Your Own Image]

The Autocrat, a being defined by its desire for order, seeks to reshape
the world into structure and control with every action.

[Create a New Society]

Voidseeker, a spiritual monk birthed by the world's empty spaces, seeks
to ensure that the world remains unfilled and devoid of any restrictive
structures.

[Nurture the World's Growth]

The Vampire, the ultimate parasite, feeding upon the world's strength,
seeks a place to latch onto the neocosm's primal essence and feast.[ [

## Character Creation

Primal World is written for Fate Accelerated, and the players should
make characters with changes described below or use the sample
characters provided below.

### Aspects

Characters in Primal World start play with two aspects, a **Name** and a
**Question**. Character Names replace their high concepts. Characters
from a primal world don't have real names. Instead, Names refer to what
they do within the world. Players choose Names that encompass their
beings, and flesh them out with a secondary clause if needed. For
example, a good Name aspect is [Breaker, destroyer of
barriers].

A PC's Question, on the other hand, is a fundamental inquiry into the
core of the character's being, a tension or a struggle within them. It
should not refer to any specific external thing---Primal World is about
exploring and discovering the world, so a Question is philosophical or
internal, and very difficult to answer. Characters are defined by both
the Question and the search for an answer. A good Question for Breaker
is [What Walls Should Never Fall?]

Compelling a Question is easy---whenever exploring or dealing with the
Question would complicate the character's life, that's a compel---but
invoking the Question may not seem obvious at first. Whenever players
try to answer the Question, they can invoke the Question aspect to their
advantage. This doesn't mean they are definitively answering the
Question---only that they are searching for meaning.

### Approaches

Player characters in Primal World start the game with a single approach
rated at +3. When choosing an approach, players can choose from the
standard Fate Accelerated approaches---Careful, Clever, Flashy,
Forceful, Quick, and Sneaky---but they can also choose a different
approach, either something from the list below, or from their own
imagination. Chosen approaches will define how characters interact with
the world, and what that world allows within it.

- Angry
- Boastful
- Brave
- Cheerful
- Co
- Crazy
- Curious
- Dangerous
- Daring
- Defiant
- Deft
- Diligent
- Dramatic
- Dutiful
- Elegant
- Faithful
- Foolish
- Frantic
- Hateful
- Honest
- Inquisitive
- Just
- Kind
- Mighty
- Mysterious
- Obedient
- Perfect
- Sad
- Sharp
- Thrill-Seeking
- Weird

When players choose (or create) an approach, ask them to answer the
following questions:

- How would someone attack in this way?
- How would someone defend in this way?
- How would someone create advantages in this way?
- How would someone overcome obstacles in this way?
- How would someone discover in this way?

For my character, Breaker, I pick the approach Angry. I answer each of
the questions:

- I would use Angry to attack someone with violence and barely
  controlled anger.
- I would use Angry to defend myself by shouting at someone, and using
  my anger to bull past any harm.
- I would use Angry to create advantages by saying things that hurt or
  anger others, or by smashing the environment around me in the right
  way.
- I would use Angry to overcome obstacles by bulling past them with
  brute force and anger.
- I would use Angry to discover by smashing and hitting to experiment
  with something, or by demanding information from other sources.

### Stunts

Player characters in Primal World still have the three stunts that
normal Fate Accelerated characters have, though none have to be chosen
at the start of play. Players should fill them in as they play and learn
more about the world and their characters.### Discovering Primal World

Primal World uses the [Discovery
action](../actions-intent-discover-fate-core/index.html), as detailed in
Fate Codex issue 1.7, page 6. You can use [[Create Advantage]] if you're not
familiar with the discover action, but you'll have to remind players
that [[Create Advantage]] can be used to unearth new information.## Character Advancement

Over the course of Primal World, characters will learn more about the
world, and in turn grow and develop themselves. By the end of each
session---in addition to any normal milestone advancements---the players
can do any of the following to solidify their characters, thereby
solidifying the world:

- Create a brand new approach held by nothing else in the world.
- Take an approach already held by another character in the world.
- Create a new aspect referring to something already established
  within the world.

### Adding Approaches

Characters have six slots for approaches: one at +3, two at +2, two at
+1, and one at +0. When taking a new approach, characters can shuffle
their existing approaches as desired, as long as they stay within their
allowed slots.

When taking a new approach, players can choose one already held by
another PC, or can take a brand new approach. If they take an existing
one, it means that the new world is starting to stabilize (see The
World's Structure, below).

### Aspects

In addition to their starting two aspects, their Name and Question,
characters can have three additional aspects. Each additional aspect
taken must refer to something external. For example, a character could
not take [Full of Hatred] as a third aspect. [Full of Hatred
for the Lizard Duke] would work, though, as it refers to
something out in the world.

Referring to something already mentioned in another PC's aspect will add
that fictional element to the world's stability table (see The World's
Structure, below).

## The World's Structure

The primal world is new, young and weak, under threat of simple
dissolution or extradimensional consumption. To solidify and stabilize
the world, the PCs have to learn about it, explore it, and take parts of
it into themselves. That means taking new aspects that refer to bits of
the discovered world, and new approaches that refer to how the world
functions.

At the start of play, the world is represented by a stability table with
five rows and three columns.

Here's what a stability table with a few spaces filled in looks like:

---

                                                           


                                                           


[The Carnivore]     [The First Sword]    
Joyful                       Curious                      Forceful
[The Lizard Duke]   Defiant                      Brave

---

Any time a PC takes an approach already held by another PC, add that
approach into the lowest, leftmost open space in the stability table.
"Lowest" supersedes "leftmost"; if there's an open space at a lower
level, then fill that before filling a spot more to the left at a higher
level.

Filled-in approaches become cemented, a part of the world. Once six
approaches have been added, no more may be added. Then, all PCs should
adjust their approaches, swapping and changing as necessary, to only use
the six approaches in the table. Subsequent NPCs from within this world
should only have approaches taken from the table.

> Brian adds Graceful to The Musician, an approach already held by
> another PC. Brian then adds Graceful to the World's table, bringing
> the total number of approaches in the table to six. All players then
> must adjust their approaches to use only the six listed on the table.
> They can change and swap their approaches as desired, so Brian puts
> Graceful into his +3 approach slot, and fills in the other slots with
> the approaches from the table.

---

                                                           


                                                           


[The Carnivore]     [The First Sword]   Graceful
Joyful                       Curious                      Forceful
[The Lizard Duke]   Defiant                      Brave

---

Any time PCs take an aspect that points at something another player's
aspect already points to, they add that fictional element to the
stability table in the lowest, leftmost possible space. This signals
that it is important: a major part of the world and a recurring item.
The fictional element becomes a pillar supporting the world's reality.

> Brian adds an aspect to The Musician: [Greatest Musician in the First
> Tower]. The First Tower is already established, and another
> PC has an aspect pointing to it. So, Brian adds "The First Tower" into
> the lowest, left-most box of the World's table.

---

                                                           


[The First Tower]                                 
[The Carnivore]     [The First Sword]   Graceful
Joyful                       Curious                      Forceful
[The Lizard Duke]   Defiant                      Brave

---

### The World's Dissolution

The world has five conditions, each with two stress boxes attached to
it. This is simple stress, so each box is worth one stress. When the
world takes stress, the players may assign that stress to whatever empty
boxes they choose.

When both boxes of a single condition are marked, the world has that
condition as an aspect. If the aspect is removed through action taken by
the PCs, then both stress boxes are cleared and can be filled again.

The world's conditions are:

[Rifts to the Outside]

[Warped Native Creatures]

[Hunters from Another Reality]

[An Outworld Shard]

[A Wellspring of Corruption]

Each condition has a specific action that must be taken to clear the
stress track and eliminate the condition. If not eliminated by the end
of session, then the condition affects the world as a whole, causing
additional problems that threaten the cosm's existence.[ [

#### Rifts to the Outside

There are gateways, tears in reality, that lead out of this world to
other places. By themselves, these rifts destabilize the primal world,
with strange effects on natural physical laws. The longer they are open,
the more likely other things are to come through...

**To Eliminate:** Close or block off the rifts.

**End of Session Effect:** Deal 1 stress to the world.

#### Warped Native Creatures

Forces from other worlds want to warp and change the creatures of the
primal world, making them a mess of twisted monstrosities. Creatures
tainted by these forces have approaches that are of the world (if there
are any), but also have monstrous alternate approaches. They are from
this world, but ruined.

To Eliminate: Find a way to uncorrupt the creatures (killing them would
damage the primal world, robbing it of its own life).

End of Session Effect: Empty the upper-rightmost slot in the world's
stability table.

#### Hunters from Another Reality

Many of other worlds happily plunder young, weak worlds, taking whatever
is valuable before returning home. These plunderers have found a way in
to the primal world. Every piece they remove from this world is another
harm dealt to it.

**To Eliminate:** Get rid of the hunters.

**End of Session Effect:** Empty the upper-rightmost slot in the world's
stability table.

#### An Outworld Shard

An outworld shard is a piece of another world, or of the Outside itself,
that has pierced the primal world. Such shards are invariably powerful,
and they are all dangerous---both to those who wield them and those who
face them. They are artifacts of astonishing power, not to be trifled
with.

**To Eliminate:** Destroy the shard, or rob it of its power.

**End of Session Effect:** Increase the difficulty of the Stability roll
by +1.

#### A Wellspring of Corruption

Wellsprings release a warping force, transforming the landscape into
something very different. If opened, a wellspring must be plugged before
it overwrites the whole of the primal world.

**To Eliminate:** Plug the wellspring, or contain it.

**End of Session Effect:** Add 1 stress to "Warped Native Creatures." If
"Warped Native Creatures" has both stress boxes filled in, then there is
no other effect.

### The World's Stability

The world has a Stability score, rated from Mediocre (+0) to Superb (+5). In the beginning, the Stability is rated at Mediocre (+0), as the
vulnerable world is unstable and impermanent. When every slot in a
single row of the table is filled in, the world's Stability goes up by

1. So if all 15 boxes across the five rows of the table are filled in,

the world's Stability is Superb (+5).

At the end of every session, the world first suffers any effects of its
current conditions, and then the players roll to determine the state of
the continued conflict for the world's stability. Roll and add the
world's Stability to the roll; compare that roll to a static Superb (+5)
difficulty, representing the inherent tendency of new worlds to
dissolve:

- On a failure, the world takes 1 stress for every [[shift]] by which it
  fails.
- On a tie, the world takes no stress, but the next time the players
  roll to determine the state of the world, the static difficulty is
  Fantastic (+6), instead of Superb (+5).
- On a success, the world suffers no stress.
- On a success with style, the world's reality has been cemented! The
  players no longer need to roll at the end of every session. The
  world's stress track is entirely cleared, and the conditions are
  removed.

## Game Structure

Primal World is about exploration and discovery; the characters discover
themselves by exploring and solidifying the world itself. During play,
put new things in front of the PCs, so they can write new aspects, and
see different approaches in action. Meanwhile, force the PCs to respond
to individual conditions that the world might incur over the course of
play.

While running Primal World, pop in new fictional elements as much as
possible, and let the PCs interact with them. Feel free to make them
dangerous, or unpleasant---even if they are predatory, they're still a
part of the primal world. When the world suffers a condition, hammer on
that condition. Bring in horrible monsters and abominations, and make
clear the consequences the world is suffering.

Using the provided Current Issue and the guidelines for Impending
Issues, you should have a strong idea of where to start, introducing
those faces and elements and exploring them. Here are some good
starting, middle, and ending scenes to help guide your play.

### Opening Scene: The Charge

The characters have gathered at the Origin for the first time. The
Calling has drawn them here, and they meet the face of the Origin.

This is a chance for these different potential aspects of the world to
meet and interact, to understand each other, and to realize their own
differing visions of what the world should be. The face of the Origin
can act as an expression of the Calling itself, giving it voice, and can
make clear the greatest immediate threat---the coming of the Carnivore.

The characters may not know about the Carnivore, but with the face
telling them that the Carnivore is crushing its way toward the Origin,
to consume the very source of the world, the Calling will compel them to
act quickly and decisively.

The face of the Origin could point them to different rumored pieces of
the primal world. The Weapon, for example---first of its kind, the
embodiment of a death-bringing tool, changing its form to suit its
wielder---could be key to slaying the Carnivore. The Stone Chains---born
from solid stone, seamless, capable of holding anything---might have
manifested to restrain the beast.

How will they face the Carnivore? How will they interact with each
other? What will the Origin and the face come to mean to them? What will
they seek for the coming battle?

Starting aspects: [At the Source of It All], [Stricken by the
Calling], [Distant Thunder of the Carnivore]

### Middle Scene: The Struggle

On their way to either find tools to use against the Carnivore, or to
find the Carnivore itself, the characters encounter more of the primal
world's nascent wonders. In this case, it's the First Cathedral, a
massive temple made from a single piece of shimmering, opalescent
crystal with spires scraping the sky. The First Faithful, creatures that
look like empty robes, inhabit and tend to the Cathedral. It's also home
to Songbird, the embodiment of music, who ran here to escape the
Carnivore's destruction.

The Cathedral, threatened by the Carnivore, stands between the creature
and the Origin. The First Faithful are just snacks for the creature;
Songbird will have to flee again, but with no place to hide besides the
Origin itself.

The Cathedral could house either the Stone Chains or the Weapon, or
something even more dangerous: Jurgen Worldhunter, bearer of Karkagandr
the Rift-Axe, has come to this world. Tearing a rift through the
Cathedral's own walls, he comes to claim this world and its treasures
for himself.

It's a dangerous situation. Can they get what they want from the
Cathedral with the First Faithful and Jurgen in their way? Can they save
Songbird? Can they direct Jurgen toward the Carnivore? [[Will]] they work
quickly enough to avoid the oncoming Carnivore?

Starting aspects: [Home to a Nascent God], [Defended by the
First Faithful], [A Light That Burns Across the
Worlds]

### Final Scene: The Battle

This is the end. The Carnivore has come, and the characters must stop
it. Maybe they can talk it down, or bind it instead of killing it, but
there's no way to avoid dealing with it.

Everything comes to a head outside the Origin. The Carnivore has carved
a trail of destruction straight towards it. It may have been diverted
around the Cathedral, but it's here now, and it's hungry. The face of
the Origin is ready to defend it, but has no real chance against a
creature as powerful as the Carnivore.

If Jurgen is around, then destroying the Carnivore and conquering the
Origin would be on his agenda, as well---the creature threatens his
spoils, and the Origin would give Jurgen access to anything he wanted.

Time to use the Weapon, or the Stone Shackles, or stand strong against
the Carnivore, and Jurgen, and all other attackers. The world itself
reacts to the oncoming battle, with thunder and lightning crackling in
the darkening skies above.

[[Will]] the Carnivore be slain, and another piece of the world lost? [[Will]]
the Origin be altered by the battle? [[Will]] Jurgen be cast from this
world? [[Will]] the face of the Origin live?

Starting aspects: [A World-Rending Battle], [Lightning and
Thunder Above], [At the Foot of the Origin]

### Next Sessions: Where to go from here?

Remember at the end of the session to make the stability roll. There's a
good chance the world will suffer some stress in the early stages, which
will lead to conditions. Press on those conditions and their
consequences to create new threats, and new places to explore. If you're
looking for more ideas, here are some elements that the characters might
find in the primal world:

#### Jethanascoriaximolonigan, the Namer

Jethanascoriaximolonigan (Jeth for short, but don't call her that) is
the Namer, whose mind is filled with possible names and identities for
the world around her. The Namer's purpose is to name things and record
them on an unending scroll she carries within her arm. Her body is
covered in myriad possible languages and glyphs. She is bald, and each
of her three eyes is a different color. One long finger on her right arm
is a quill that oozes ink, and with a simple shuffle of her left arm,
her scroll unfurls itself. Any name she records, she sees as writ upon
the very fabric of the world.

- Curious +3

#### The Sphere of the Dead

The Sphere---enormous and impenetrably black---floats above the world.
One can pass through it, like passing through a thick sludge; inside are
the souls of the dead, their memories encased for eternity. The world is
new and young, and life is just beginning, but already the Sphere is a
constant reminder of the end. Perhaps when the world is older, the
Sphere will grow and move away from the skies, but for now it floats
above as a dark omen in the sky.

- [Visible in the Sky Across the World]
- [Open to the Living]

#### Seer

Seer is a scout for the Things from Outside. A horrible creature, made
of crystal held together by sinew and muscle. Each crystal looks like an
eye, aimed in a different direction on its spherical body. Seer
perceives the world, so the Things can find it. It undermines the
structure of the primal world merely by observing it. Seer has no
interest in killing or feeding on anything in the world itself---it
instead seeks the most succulent morsels for its masters to consume.

## Sample Characters## The Rebel

The Rebel opposes order and stagnation, law and structure. The Rebel
seeks to keep the primal world constantly shifting, eternally changing.
Anything static and unmoving gets the Rebel's attention, and the Rebel
is always on the verge of disobedience. The Rebel will stand against
corruption, or the completely unnatural change brought on by the
incursions of external monstrosities...unless the Rebel can be convinced
of that strange, corruptive change's value.

## The Terror

The Terror is the embodiment of fear, an entire being focused on
understanding the necessity of fear. The Terror is interested in all
facets of fear---its creation and its experience. The external creatures
that come into the world are not a part of it, and the fear they create
is unnatural, but...instructive, to the Terror.

## The Defender

The Defender is a wall against destruction and unmaking. But the
Defender isn't defined by what it defends, only that it defends. Being a
wall has little meaning, though, unless there is something on each side,
something to keep out and to keep in. Perhaps the externals are exactly
the threat it needs to solidify its own existence: the wall between the
monsters from beyond and this world. But if that were so...would the
Defender truly want to shut those monsters out for good? Or would it
want a constant trickling threat to defend against forever?

## The Student

The Student embodies learning. Investigation. Exploration. Discovery.
The Student seeks knowledge, of this world and the many spheres beyond.
The Student is powerful for all the knowledge it has and collects, but
it is also dangerous, as all power swings both ways. If the Student is
willing to do nearly anything to learn, then it might make for a
dangerous ally to the invaders into the primal world....
