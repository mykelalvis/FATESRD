## A Dark World

Most people go about their lives without ever knowing the true nature of
this world. They never have to deal with the strange or unexplainable,
the horrors that prowl in the night. These are considered the stuff of
legend, fairytale, and old folk tales. In the eyes of most people,
monsters and the occult belong in a darker, more ignorant era. Modernity
has banished these beasts and burdens as surely as it banished polio and
tuberculosis.

Yet nothing could be further from the truth. Every story you have heard
is real; every folk tale, every urban legend, every ghost story and
fairy tale has its roots in the truth. Vampires, werewolves, fairies,
goblins, and other alien monsters---these are things that go bump in the
night and prey upon the innocent.

They once roamed freely and openly during ages of antiquity---the very
reason we have stories chronicling their existence. But something
happened---humanity grew bolder, more organized, more disciplined. The
Renaissance occurred, and from there came the Enlightenment. They fought
back and developed weapons capable of fighting off the night terrors.
Licking their collective wounds, the supernatural entities sulked back
into the darkness, biding their time and waiting to rise again.

### Those Who [[Fight]] the Darkness

Over the centuries that humanity warred against monsters, organized
groups emerged to carry forward the flame into the darkness. Originally
during the Holy Roman Empire, and later the Dark and Middle Ages,
humanity created Esoteric Fraternal Orders and Sisterhoods, sects of the
Church, secret societies, and many others. As the monsters retreated to
the shadows, so too did these noble institutions, fading from our
collective memory, erasing their tracks to keep us safe.

Today, each of these groups recruits the most spiritually aware
individuals, teaching them their traditions and educating them about how
the world really works. Members of these groups are tasked with keeping
humanity safe from the threats that nightly prey upon it while also
hiding the truth.

The most famous and widespread of these organizations are the Scions of
the Sun---an organization dating back to the year 1290 A.D. The Scions
have long fought supernatural forces while pretending to be mere
business leaders or members of society. In this day and age, the Scions
are still present, and most think of them as a mere fraternal charitable
organization engaged in fundraisers and civic service. However, the
inner circle of the Scions are still intimately involved in defending
humanity's interests against encroachment by the supernatural.

### Those Who Live in the Darkness

While groups like the Scions battle to keep us safe, some humans have
always succumbed to the influence of the darkness, losing their humanity
to become something...other. Whether these people have become sorcerers,
vampires, werewolves, or demonic servants, they now belong to forces few
could understand. Some are completely lost to the monstrous parts of
their souls; others, clinging to the last vestiges of their humanity,
fight to hold back the darkness even as they must slake inhuman
appetites.

### The Struggle

Presently, the conflicts among the supernatural and humanity resemble a
free-for-all rather than an organized war. Supernatural factions are
just as likely to squabble and fight one another as they are to try and
gain a foothold against humanity in the world. The disorganization of
the forces of darkness gives humanity's defenders an advantage; their
cause unites them against our enemies. Yet as humanity itself pushes
deeper into the shadows---exploring what few places have thus far gone
unexplored---it is only a matter of time before humanity is once again
made aware of the cousin spirits who inhabit the world.

## Setting Creation

As a Quick Start Adventure for [[Fate Core]], Innocence Lost has everything
you need to jump right into your first session. Before you start,
discuss the broader setting with your group, perhaps even reading aloud
the descriptions of A Dark World, Those Who [[Fight]] the Darkness, Those
Who Live in the Darkness, and The Struggle so everyone is on the same
page.

At the start of play, explain the **current issue** to your players and
ask them to fill in one or two additional faces associated with [The
Children Are Missing]. These additional characters will provide
new plot hooks and twists that will tie your players more deeply to the
current mystic happenings.

Then ask your players to choose from one of the two available
**impending issues**: [Supernatural Serial Killer], or [A
Convergence Is Occurring]. Have them fill in one or two
additional faces for their chosen impending issue as well, rounding out
the larger cast of characters with their suggestions.

### Current Issue: The Children Are Missing

Children across the city have begun to go missing without notice. They
come from a diverse set of homes and circumstances, and the
investigations surrounding their disappearances routinely clear parents
and close family members of any wrongdoing. The current working theory
that police are exploring is that a single kidnapper is behind the
disappearances. However, at the scene of each disappearance are drawings
made by each child that point to a unifying supernatural element. In
actuality, the children are being called by a powerful ancient artifact
known as The Arch, and crossing through it to dimensions unknown. (For
more information on The Arch, see The Fate Codex Issue 3, Vol. 4).

Faces:

- Austin Chang, Frightened Father
- Mia Pine, Conspiracy Theorist### The Arch

For the duration of the main issue [The Children Are Missing],
The arch calls out to the minds of the weak or vulnerable. It grants +2
to all overcome rolls made by individuals who seek it out with a skill,
skill mode, or approach rated Average (+1), Mediocre (+0), or worse.### Impending Issues

In addition to The Children Are Missing and the investigation around it,
there are a number of other impending issues that are of concern to the
player characters.

#### Supernatural Serial Killer

Over the past year, a serial killer has struck. Victims are brutally and
savagely murdered, torn apart by something seemingly inhuman. There
seems to be no rhyme or reason to when and where the victims are
attacked, save that each attack occurs under cover of night. Sometimes
the killer strikes multiple times in a single week; other times it won't
strike for months at a stretch. Again, for those with the sense for
these things, the crimes seem to have a distinctly supernatural element
to them.

Faces:

- Jacoby Hill, Newspaper Photographer
- Det. Elisa May, Dogged Law Woman

#### A Convergence Is Occurring

One thing that the supernatural community is in agreement on is that
some sort of mystical convergence is about to occur. The stars are
right, ley lines seem turbo-charged with power, signs and omens are
appearing with increasing frequency. Something big is about to occur,
and everyone wants a piece of the action. Esoteric factions are
beginning to squabble and fight over the power, and their fights
threaten to spill out into public.

Faces:

- Jamal Uribe, Occultist Extraordiniare
- Nyoko Hoshi, Spirit Enforcer ![[cards-2.png]]

## Character Creation

Innocence Lost works best with [[Fate Core]] characters---the existence of
the [[Fate Core]] skills lend themselves well to the street-level
supernatural feel of an Innocence Lost game; you can use Fate
Accelerated approaches instead of the more traditional skills if you
prefer the simplicity of FAE.

In Innocence Lost, players take on the roles of supernatural
investigators. Characters fall into one of two categories: awakened
humans or supernatural entities. During character creation, each player
chooses which category applies to their character. Members of each group
possess abilities above and beyond the average human being, people who
are uniquely suited to solve the supernatural problems besetting the
city on all sides.

### Awakened Humans

Awakened humans are human beings who have been inducted into the
mysteries of the esoteric world. Some gained their awareness through
formal education or induction, others by witnessing firsthand the
horrors that stalk the night. Most awakened human beings have turned to
the occult as a way of evening the odds with their opponents. They
utilize spells, charms, and sigils, and seek out artifacts of power.
Others instead decide to devote themselves to achieving peak
physicality, reaching new levels of human excellence to defend humanity
from the darkness.

### Supernatural Entities

Supernatural entities used to be human. Through some trauma or
inevitable transformation, they have become something different
altogether. Characters can be any kind of supernatural entity that makes
sense to the group and Gamemaster. Common kinds of supernatural entities
for player characters are vampires, werewolves, ghosts, gargoyles, or
reanimated corpses.

### Character Creation

Players should create characters normally as per the [[Fate Core]]
rules---including five core Aspects (High Concept, Trouble, etc.),
traditional [[Fate Core]] Skills, and normal refresh---with one added twist:
each player must randomly determine what supernatural touch has
afflicted their character. This randomness represents the unasked-for
fate of being drawn into the supernatural war.

Each player can either determine their character's Supernatural Touch
first, allowing them to build the rest of their character around this
element, or they can roll it at the end of character creation. The first
option allows players to create characters who are veterans in the
supernatural war. The second option better represents someone who lived
a normal life that was suddenly derailed by the supernatural.### Random Character Creation

This system for random character creation is drawn from [Fate
Lifepaths](../random-character-creation-fate-core/index.html) by
Philippe Saner in The Fate Codex Volume 3, Issue 3. Check it out to
learn more about generating random characters in [[Fate Core]]!The Supernatural Touch represents the basic abilities that each
supernatural character gains. Feel free to create other supernatural
stunts and extras at the game-table that bolster the themes and
abilities of each character.

To use the Supernatural Touch tables, roll the four Fate dice. Starting
in the top-left corner, move one column right for each +, and one row
down for each -.

## Running Innocence Lost as an Improvizational Mystery

This same issue of the Fate Codex provides rules and guidelines for
running mystery games that are improvizational in nature. (See
[Improvizational Mysteries](../improvizational-mysteries/index.html) by
Felipe Real). The scenes described in this Quick Start provide you with
the basic outlines of the information necessary to run this scenario.
Using those rules, when the PCs investigate, have them roll [[Notice]] to
create an advantage. As described more fully in Felipe's article, each
advantage created represents a clue that they found at the scene.

To make full use of those rules, flesh out the NPCs more to make them
potential suspects in this mystery. Or, instead of suspects, have each
clue lead the PCs to eventually discovering the truth about the Arch.

The ultimate question for you as a GM, though, is how far do you follow
the improvizational nature of the mystery? Do you tie it back in to the
plotline articulated here, or do you follow the theories and thoughts of
the players, no matter how far afield from the written scenes in this
Quick Start? This is something to think about as you prepare for the
game session, and is likely a judgment call that you will have
to---ironically---improvise at the table.

### Opening Scene: The Scene of the Crime

The player characters are granted a chance to investigate the most
recent child disappearance. The players were expressly sought out for
their expertise in the occult. They were contacted directly by Austin
Chang, the father of the missing child, who is desperate to get his
five-year-old daughter Alice back---so desperate that he's willing to
entertain the possibility of supernatural explanations for his
daughter's disappearance. Austin was referred to the PCs by Mia Pine, a
local conspiracy theorist blogger who suspects the PCs' connection to
the occult.

When the PCs show up at the Chang household, Mia is present, and Austin
and his husband are arguing about consulting occultists in finding their
daughter. Eventually, Austin's husband relents and they allow the PCs to
enter their house and begin to investigate for clues surrounding their
daughter's disappearance.

Their daughter's room is filled with toys, and shows no sign of a
struggle. If the PCs are diligent, they eventually find a sketchpad that
the little girl uses for drawings. The first third of the book contains
childish drawings of her, her family, friends, and television
characters. After a third way through the sketchbook, the drawings take
on a more sinister tone. She began to draw pictures of quadrupedal
eyeless monsters and a doorway that appears to be covered in bones. In
all the pictures, there is running water---likely indicating that the
drawing occurred near the river that runs through the city.

The PCs can attempt to reach out to parents of the other children who
have gone missing. In all cases, they can discover nearly identical
drawings at those households. Whatever happens, Mia insists on tagging
along with the PCs so that she can write about the investigation for her
blog. If the PCs refuse to allow her to join them, she concedes to their
wishes, but trails them in secret, using a video recorder to document
their actions.## Austin Chang

The PCs followup on the drawings contained in the Changs' house and can
investigate the river that their daughter drew. Along the riverbanks,
there are the signs of some kind of animal lairing there---the corpses
of small animals, raccoons, dogs, cats, but no human remains.

As the PCs investigate, eventually they are attacked by a ghastly and
unnatural creature: an archspawn. The archspawn is a quadruped roughly
the size of a large dog with black rubbery skin, razor-sharp teeth and
claws, and no eyes. It has a long wiry tail and moves with the grace and
ease of a jungle predator. If the PCs begin to gain the edge, the
archspawn will concede the fight, running away from the PCs, leaving a
clear trail for the PCs to track the creature back to where it
originally came from.## Archspawn Creature

High Concept: [A Creature from Beyond]

Trouble: [Leaves Behind the Corpses of Small Animals]

### Skill Modes

Fair (+2) Hunting, running, attacking, and hiding.

### Stress

□□□### Final Scene: Enter The Arch

The PCs can follow the creature back to an empty warehouse along the
riverfront. They see it enter the warehouse, but it is in hiding if they
follow it inside. The warehouse contains a powerful eldritch artifact
known as The Arch. Strewn all over the floor of the warehouse are
children's toys and drawings much like those found at the Chang's
household.

The Arch is a powerful gateway that connects locations across time and
space. Characters who are occult-trained can attempt to roll [[Lore]] to
overcome a Superb (+5) obstacle. Succeeding allows the character to
recognize The Arch as an item written of in rumored tones. The character
knows that the Arch calls out subtly to the weak and vulnerable in
society, hypnotically enticing them to walk through the gate. Those who
enter The Arch are never heard from again.

As the PCs investigate the area, The Arch flares to life, and one more
archspawn as well as a greater archspawn emerge from it. The original
archspawn chooses this time to emerge from hiding and join up with the
new arrivals to attack the PCs. After these new creatures arrive, The
Arch flashes in a blinding display of light and disappears from the
warehouse.

If Mia Pine is still following the PCs at this point, she makes her
presence known after witnessing the battle, and seeing The Arch
disappear. She's insistent that she's going to blog all about it and
expose the truth of the Dark World to all of humanity. The players are
left with the sinking feeling that Alice Chang and the other children
are gone from this world forever---something they must now tell Austin
and his husband. Sometimes being a hero sucks.## Greater Archspawn

Trouble: [Too Rabid for This World]

### Skills

Great (+4) [[Athletics]], [[Fight]]

Good (+3) [[Notice]], [[Stealth]]

danger. Your [[Notice]] skill works unimpeded by conditions like total
concealment, darkness, or other sensory impairments in situations where

Heavy Hitter. When you succeed with Style on a [[Fight]] attack and choose
to reduce the result by one to gain a boost, you gain a full situation
aspect with a [[free invocation]] instead.

Sprinter. You move two zones for free in a conflict without rolling,
instead of one, provided there are no situation aspects restricting
movement.

### Stress

Physical: □□□ Mental: □□

### Consequences

Mild (2) | Moderate (4) | Major (6)## Plot Hooks and Adventure Seeds

The adventures of the PCs can continue beyond this scenario! The players
may be determined to find the children---even if the search puts them in
grave danger---or they may now find their hands full with Mia's threat
to expose the supernatural world to the public at large.

### Charting the Arch's Next Appearance

The PCs can consult occultic tomes to learn as much as they can about
The Arch. If they're persistent, they can learn that there is an obscure
and rare tome that claims to contain vast amounts of information about
The Arch. Among its rumored contents is a means for charting The Arch's
next appearance, or summoning it altogether. The PCs can try to track
down this tome, facing opposition and challenges along the way. Once
they procure the tome, how accurate is it really? And will its
information provide them with any measure of control over The Arch?

### Keeping Mia Quiet

Mia Pine now has video proof that the world contains dark terrors. She
believes that for the good of the public, this information must come to
light. However, this insistence on exposure flies in the face of the
global esoteric consensus that such matters are not for public
consumption. What will the PCs do about Mia? [[Will]] they aid her in
exposing the truth? Or will they go to extreme lengths to silence her?

### The Children's Crusade

A month after The Arch disappears, people begin to report sightings of
the vanished children, including Alice Chang. Sightings report that they
see the children in public, appearing translucent and weeping. Attempts
to communicate with and console the children are ignored, and the
children vanish in front of the witness's eyes. What's going on? Is
there a chance that the missing children can still be found? Or is this
some cruel after-image produced by The Arch?

### Austin Chang, Man on a Mission

Grief is a powerful emotion that can cloud the mind. If the PCs report
to Austin and his husband that Alice is gone forever, Austin blames the
group for his daughter's disappearance. He accuses them of offering his
family false hope and swears that he will go to any length possible to
make the PCs feel the pain and loss that he feels. As a powerful banker
in the city, he has the means to do it and reaches out to the PCs
landlords and employers, doing anything he can to get them evicted or
fired. These are only the first steps in his quest to completely ruin
them. How will the PCs deal with this powerful but mundane threat to
their lives while juggling their investigations of supernatural
activities?## Det. Elisa May

Elisa May is a relentless detective. However, after being attacked by a
strange dog earlier this year, she's been having blackouts, and has no
clue what's happening during that time. She's beginning to suspect that
there's more to the world than she knew.

## A Dark World

Most people go about their lives without ever knowing the true nature of
this world. They never have to deal with the strange or unexplainable,
the horrors that prowl in the night. These are considered the stuff of
legend, fairytale, and old folk tales. In the eyes of most people,
monsters and the occult belong in a darker, more ignorant era. Modernity
has banished these beasts and burdens as surely as it banished polio and
tuberculosis.

Yet nothing could be further from the truth. Every story you have heard
is real; every folk tale, every urban legend, every ghost story and
fairy tale has its roots in the truth. Vampires, werewolves, fairies,
goblins, and other alien monsters---these are things that go bump in the
night and prey upon the innocent.

They once roamed freely and openly during ages of antiquity---the very
reason we have stories chronicling their existence. But something
happened---humanity grew bolder, more organized, more disciplined. The
Renaissance occurred, and from there came the Enlightenment. They fought
back and developed weapons capable of fighting off the night terrors.
Licking their collective wounds, the supernatural entities sulked back
into the darkness, biding their time and waiting to rise again.

### Those Who [[Fight]] the Darkness

Over the centuries that humanity warred against monsters, organized
groups emerged to carry forward the flame into the darkness. Originally
during the Holy Roman Empire, and later the Dark and Middle Ages,
humanity created Esoteric Fraternal Orders and Sisterhoods, sects of the
Church, secret societies, and many others. As the monsters retreated to
the shadows, so too did these noble institutions, fading from our
collective memory, erasing their tracks to keep us safe.

Today, each of these groups recruits the most spiritually aware
individuals, teaching them their traditions and educating them about how
the world really works. Members of these groups are tasked with keeping
humanity safe from the threats that nightly prey upon it while also
hiding the truth.

The most famous and widespread of these organizations are the Scions of
the Sun---an organization dating back to the year 1290 A.D. The Scions
have long fought supernatural forces while pretending to be mere
business leaders or members of society. In this day and age, the Scions
are still present, and most think of them as a mere fraternal charitable
organization engaged in fundraisers and civic service. However, the
inner circle of the Scions are still intimately involved in defending
humanity's interests against encroachment by the supernatural.

### Those Who Live in the Darkness

While groups like the Scions battle to keep us safe, some humans have
always succumbed to the influence of the darkness, losing their humanity
to become something...other. Whether these people have become sorcerers,
vampires, werewolves, or demonic servants, they now belong to forces few
could understand. Some are completely lost to the monstrous parts of
their souls; others, clinging to the last vestiges of their humanity,
fight to hold back the darkness even as they must slake inhuman
appetites.

### The Struggle

Presently, the conflicts among the supernatural and humanity resemble a
free-for-all rather than an organized war. Supernatural factions are
just as likely to squabble and fight one another as they are to try and
gain a foothold against humanity in the world. The disorganization of
the forces of darkness gives humanity's defenders an advantage; their
cause unites them against our enemies. Yet as humanity itself pushes
deeper into the shadows---exploring what few places have thus far gone
unexplored---it is only a matter of time before humanity is once again
made aware of the cousin spirits who inhabit the world.

## Setting Creation

As a Quick Start Adventure for [[Fate Core]], Innocence Lost has everything
you need to jump right into your first session. Before you start,
discuss the broader setting with your group, perhaps even reading aloud
the descriptions of A Dark World, Those Who [[Fight]] the Darkness, Those
Who Live in the Darkness, and The Struggle so everyone is on the same
page.

At the start of play, explain the **current issue** to your players and
ask them to fill in one or two additional faces associated with [The
Children Are Missing]. These additional characters will provide
new plot hooks and twists that will tie your players more deeply to the
current mystic happenings.

Then ask your players to choose from one of the two available
**impending issues**: [Supernatural Serial Killer], or [A
Convergence Is Occurring]. Have them fill in one or two
additional faces for their chosen impending issue as well, rounding out
the larger cast of characters with their suggestions.

### Current Issue: The Children Are Missing

Children across the city have begun to go missing without notice. They
come from a diverse set of homes and circumstances, and the
investigations surrounding their disappearances routinely clear parents
and close family members of any wrongdoing. The current working theory
that police are exploring is that a single kidnapper is behind the
disappearances. However, at the scene of each disappearance are drawings
made by each child that point to a unifying supernatural element. In
actuality, the children are being called by a powerful ancient artifact
known as The Arch, and crossing through it to dimensions unknown. (For
more information on The Arch, see The Fate Codex Issue 3, Vol. 4).

Faces:

- Austin Chang, Frightened Father
- Mia Pine, Conspiracy Theorist### The Arch

For the duration of the main issue [The Children Are Missing],
The arch calls out to the minds of the weak or vulnerable. It grants +2
to all overcome rolls made by individuals who seek it out with a skill,
skill mode, or approach rated Average (+1), Mediocre (+0), or worse.### Impending Issues

In addition to The Children Are Missing and the investigation around it,
there are a number of other impending issues that are of concern to the
player characters.

#### Supernatural Serial Killer

Over the past year, a serial killer has struck. Victims are brutally and
savagely murdered, torn apart by something seemingly inhuman. There
seems to be no rhyme or reason to when and where the victims are
attacked, save that each attack occurs under cover of night. Sometimes
the killer strikes multiple times in a single week; other times it won't
strike for months at a stretch. Again, for those with the sense for
these things, the crimes seem to have a distinctly supernatural element
to them.

Faces:

- Jacoby Hill, Newspaper Photographer
- Det. Elisa May, Dogged Law Woman

#### A Convergence Is Occurring

One thing that the supernatural community is in agreement on is that
some sort of mystical convergence is about to occur. The stars are
right, ley lines seem turbo-charged with power, signs and omens are
appearing with increasing frequency. Something big is about to occur,
and everyone wants a piece of the action. Esoteric factions are
beginning to squabble and fight over the power, and their fights
threaten to spill out into public.

Faces:

- Jamal Uribe, Occultist Extraordiniare
- Nyoko Hoshi, Spirit Enforcer

## Character Creation

Innocence Lost works best with [[Fate Core]] characters---the existence of
the [[Fate Core]] skills lend themselves well to the street-level
supernatural feel of an Innocence Lost game; you can use Fate
Accelerated approaches instead of the more traditional skills if you
prefer the simplicity of FAE.

In Innocence Lost, players take on the roles of supernatural
investigators. Characters fall into one of two categories: awakened
humans or supernatural entities. During character creation, each player
chooses which category applies to their character. Members of each group
possess abilities above and beyond the average human being, people who
are uniquely suited to solve the supernatural problems besetting the
city on all sides.

### Awakened Humans

Awakened humans are human beings who have been inducted into the
mysteries of the esoteric world. Some gained their awareness through
formal education or induction, others by witnessing firsthand the
horrors that stalk the night. Most awakened human beings have turned to
the occult as a way of evening the odds with their opponents. They
utilize spells, charms, and sigils, and seek out artifacts of power.
Others instead decide to devote themselves to achieving peak
physicality, reaching new levels of human excellence to defend humanity
from the darkness.

### Supernatural Entities

Supernatural entities used to be human. Through some trauma or
inevitable transformation, they have become something different
altogether. Characters can be any kind of supernatural entity that makes
sense to the group and Gamemaster. Common kinds of supernatural entities
for player characters are vampires, werewolves, ghosts, gargoyles, or
reanimated corpses.

### Character Creation

Players should create characters normally as per the [[Fate Core]]
rules---including five core Aspects (High Concept, Trouble, etc.),
traditional [[Fate Core]] Skills, and normal refresh---with one added twist:
each player must randomly determine what supernatural touch has
afflicted their character. This randomness represents the unasked-for
fate of being drawn into the supernatural war.

Each player can either determine their character's Supernatural Touch
first, allowing them to build the rest of their character around this
element, or they can roll it at the end of character creation. The first
option allows players to create characters who are veterans in the
supernatural war. The second option better represents someone who lived
a normal life that was suddenly derailed by the supernatural.### Random Character Creation

This system for random character creation is drawn from [Fate
Lifepaths](../random-character-creation-fate-core/index.html) by
Philippe Saner in The Fate Codex Volume 3, Issue 3. Check it out to
learn more about generating random characters in [[Fate Core]]!The Supernatural Touch represents the basic abilities that each
supernatural character gains. Feel free to create other supernatural
stunts and extras at the game-table that bolster the themes and
abilities of each character.

To use the Supernatural Touch tables, roll the four Fate dice. Starting
in the top-left corner, move one column right for each +, and one row
down for each -.

## Running Innocence Lost as an Improvizational Mystery

This same issue of the Fate Codex provides rules and guidelines for
running mystery games that are improvizational in nature. (See
[Improvizational Mysteries](../improvizational-mysteries/index.html) by
Felipe Real). The scenes described in this Quick Start provide you with
the basic outlines of the information necessary to run this scenario.
Using those rules, when the PCs investigate, have them roll [[Notice]] to
create an advantage. As described more fully in Felipe's article, each
advantage created represents a clue that they found at the scene.

To make full use of those rules, flesh out the NPCs more to make them
potential suspects in this mystery. Or, instead of suspects, have each
clue lead the PCs to eventually discovering the truth about the Arch.

The ultimate question for you as a GM, though, is how far do you follow
the improvizational nature of the mystery? Do you tie it back in to the
plotline articulated here, or do you follow the theories and thoughts of
the players, no matter how far afield from the written scenes in this
Quick Start? This is something to think about as you prepare for the
game session, and is likely a judgment call that you will have
to---ironically---improvise at the table.

### Opening Scene: The Scene of the Crime

The player characters are granted a chance to investigate the most
recent child disappearance. The players were expressly sought out for
their expertise in the occult. They were contacted directly by Austin
Chang, the father of the missing child, who is desperate to get his
five-year-old daughter Alice back---so desperate that he's willing to
entertain the possibility of supernatural explanations for his
daughter's disappearance. Austin was referred to the PCs by Mia Pine, a
local conspiracy theorist blogger who suspects the PCs' connection to
the occult.

When the PCs show up at the Chang household, Mia is present, and Austin
and his husband are arguing about consulting occultists in finding their
daughter. Eventually, Austin's husband relents and they allow the PCs to
enter their house and begin to investigate for clues surrounding their
daughter's disappearance.

Their daughter's room is filled with toys, and shows no sign of a
struggle. If the PCs are diligent, they eventually find a sketchpad that
the little girl uses for drawings. The first third of the book contains
childish drawings of her, her family, friends, and television
characters. After a third way through the sketchbook, the drawings take
on a more sinister tone. She began to draw pictures of quadrupedal
eyeless monsters and a doorway that appears to be covered in bones. In
all the pictures, there is running water---likely indicating that the
drawing occurred near the river that runs through the city.

The PCs can attempt to reach out to parents of the other children who
have gone missing. In all cases, they can discover nearly identical
drawings at those households. Whatever happens, Mia insists on tagging
along with the PCs so that she can write about the investigation for her
blog. If the PCs refuse to allow her to join them, she concedes to their
wishes, but trails them in secret, using a video recorder to document
their actions.## Austin Chang

The PCs followup on the drawings contained in the Changs' house and can
investigate the river that their daughter drew. Along the riverbanks,
there are the signs of some kind of animal lairing there---the corpses
of small animals, raccoons, dogs, cats, but no human remains.

As the PCs investigate, eventually they are attacked by a ghastly and
unnatural creature: an archspawn. The archspawn is a quadruped roughly
the size of a large dog with black rubbery skin, razor-sharp teeth and
claws, and no eyes. It has a long wiry tail and moves with the grace and
ease of a jungle predator. If the PCs begin to gain the edge, the
archspawn will concede the fight, running away from the PCs, leaving a
clear trail for the PCs to track the creature back to where it
originally came from.## Archspawn Creature

High Concept: [A Creature from Beyond]

Trouble: [Leaves Behind the Corpses of Small Animals]

### Skill Modes

Fair (+2) Hunting, running, attacking, and hiding.

### Stress

□□□### Final Scene: Enter The Arch

The PCs can follow the creature back to an empty warehouse along the
riverfront. They see it enter the warehouse, but it is in hiding if they
follow it inside. The warehouse contains a powerful eldritch artifact
known as The Arch. Strewn all over the floor of the warehouse are
children's toys and drawings much like those found at the Chang's
household.

The Arch is a powerful gateway that connects locations across time and
space. Characters who are occult-trained can attempt to roll [[Lore]] to
overcome a Superb (+5) obstacle. Succeeding allows the character to
recognize The Arch as an item written of in rumored tones. The character
knows that the Arch calls out subtly to the weak and vulnerable in
society, hypnotically enticing them to walk through the gate. Those who
enter The Arch are never heard from again.

As the PCs investigate the area, The Arch flares to life, and one more
archspawn as well as a greater archspawn emerge from it. The original
archspawn chooses this time to emerge from hiding and join up with the
new arrivals to attack the PCs. After these new creatures arrive, The
Arch flashes in a blinding display of light and disappears from the
warehouse.

If Mia Pine is still following the PCs at this point, she makes her
presence known after witnessing the battle, and seeing The Arch
disappear. She's insistent that she's going to blog all about it and
expose the truth of the Dark World to all of humanity. The players are
left with the sinking feeling that Alice Chang and the other children
are gone from this world forever---something they must now tell Austin
and his husband. Sometimes being a hero sucks.## Greater Archspawn

Trouble: [Too Rabid for This World]

### Skills

Great (+4) [[Athletics]], [[Fight]]

Good (+3) [[Notice]], [[Stealth]]

danger. Your [[Notice]] skill works unimpeded by conditions like total
concealment, darkness, or other sensory impairments in situations where

to reduce the result by one to gain a boost, you gain a full situation
aspect with a [[free invocation]] instead.

Sprinter. You move two zones for free in a conflict without rolling,
instead of one, provided there are no situation aspects restricting
movement.

### Stress

Physical: □□□ Mental: □□

### Consequences

Mild (2) | Moderate (4) | Major (6)## Plot Hooks and Adventure Seeds

The adventures of the PCs can continue beyond this scenario! The players
may be determined to find the children---even if the search puts them in
grave danger---or they may now find their hands full with Mia's threat
to expose the supernatural world to the public at large.

### Charting the Arch's Next Appearance

The PCs can consult occultic tomes to learn as much as they can about
The Arch. If they're persistent, they can learn that there is an obscure
and rare tome that claims to contain vast amounts of information about
The Arch. Among its rumored contents is a means for charting The Arch's
next appearance, or summoning it altogether. The PCs can try to track
down this tome, facing opposition and challenges along the way. Once
they procure the tome, how accurate is it really? And will its
information provide them with any measure of control over The Arch?

### Keeping Mia Quiet

Mia Pine now has video proof that the world contains dark terrors. She
believes that for the good of the public, this information must come to
light. However, this insistence on exposure flies in the face of the
global esoteric consensus that such matters are not for public
consumption. What will the PCs do about Mia? [[Will]] they aid her in
exposing the truth? Or will they go to extreme lengths to silence her?

### The Children's Crusade

A month after The Arch disappears, people begin to report sightings of
the vanished children, including Alice Chang. Sightings report that they
see the children in public, appearing translucent and weeping. Attempts
to communicate with and console the children are ignored, and the
children vanish in front of the witness's eyes. What's going on? Is
there a chance that the missing children can still be found? Or is this
some cruel after-image produced by The Arch?

### Austin Chang, Man on a Mission

Grief is a powerful emotion that can cloud the mind. If the PCs report
to Austin and his husband that Alice is gone forever, Austin blames the
group for his daughter's disappearance. He accuses them of offering his
family false hope and swears that he will go to any length possible to
make the PCs feel the pain and loss that he feels. As a powerful banker
in the city, he has the means to do it and reaches out to the PCs
landlords and employers, doing anything he can to get them evicted or
fired. These are only the first steps in his quest to completely ruin
them. How will the PCs deal with this powerful but mundane threat to
their lives while juggling their investigations of supernatural
activities?## Det. Elisa May

Elisa May is a relentless detective. However, after being attacked by a
strange dog earlier this year, she's been having blackouts, and has no
clue what's happening during that time. She's beginning to suspect that
there's more to the world than she knew.
