# Feminine Horror

by Sarah Richardson

Horror is personal, and many women have a complicated relationship with
it. In horror movies, we're often cast as the first to fall---usually in
the guise of the promiscuous hot babe who always trips while running
away---yet we're also the final girl---the last survivor with the
gender-neutral name who gives the baddie some sorely needed comeuppance.
Horror from a feminine perspective usually involves powerlessness,
taking place on and inside of our bodies, and in spaces that are
supposed to be free from danger. It's also frequently used as an object
lesson to teach us that we are at least partly to blame for what is done
to us.

A lot of the horror women experience in real life takes place in our
homes and workplaces, perpetrated by people we know: our homes,
partners, coworkers, even our children can be dangerous. A good GM can
reproduce that horrific intimacy at the table by subverting common
roleplaying tropes and introducting feminine horror. For example, many
games assume the players will be exceptional people in the foreground,
and they tend to ignore the unexceptional people in the background.
However, our domestic spaces are ripe for terror, and the main roles are
filled with people we can identify with---servant, teacher, nanny, cook,
parent, babysitter, daughter, secretary, wife. Feminine horror deals
with things that should be familiar and comforting, but instead are full
of terror.

In this article, I discuss how to bring the uniquely feminine horror
themes of the onset of menstruation, women's sexuality, and pregnancy to
your gaming table, including aspects you can use to drive home specific
themes, stunts for the players to cope with the terror, and example set
ups to get your table right into the horror.

## Player vs. Player Horror

One feature I emphasize throughout this piece is a player vs. player
mechanic where players can spend a [[fate point]] to give another player a
thematic consequence, spreading the horror around and encouraging the
kind of selfish behavior you often see in horror movies; each person
tries to survive at the expense of everyone else. In the player vs.
player feature, players can spend a [[fate point]] to give each other
consequences, which can later be compelled with another [[fate point]].
These consequences fill the moderate consequence slot, as they weaken
the character and make them more susceptible to the horror around them.

Characters can only start to recover from the consequence by resolving
the fiction around it, and then it will be gone at the next session. For
example, if you are given the Infected consequence, you could resolve it
by surrendering yourself to the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention so that they could make a vaccine. These consequences stay
with the original carrier even when they give it to another character,
so you can watch the horror spread throughout the group---and it means
most of the PCs will have aspects the GM and other players can compel to
make the game that much creepier.### Before We Begin...

Playing horror games can be really intense, so make sure both your
players and yourself are comfortable. A good horror game manages to
terrify and make players uncomfortable without crossing their
boundaries, just pushing them right up to that edge. Here are a few
methods to help you do that:

Above all else, make sure your players know that horror is on the table;
it's not fun to get surprised with horror when you were expecting a
light-hearted comedy!## Menarche

For many young women, their own maturing bodies can be confusing, or
even something to be feared. Even if you've been told about the process,
actually experiencing the blood, cramps, and mood swings can be
terrifying. It can feel like your own body has turned against you, and
it's even worse for young women who aren't prepared. Blood is a scary
thing that means injury in most cases, but it also symbolizes life and
transformation, especially in the transition from childhood to
adulthood. The changing body of a teenager is a perfect canvas for
horror.

Teenagers with newly developed powers is a popular game concept, but it
can turn to horror when you focus more explicitly on body horror and a
dawning sense of being different, even dangerous. Players can still pick
what type of talent their character has, but it should manifest in
unexpected or disturbing ways. Powers sound cool, but not if you can't
control them, or are unprepared for the new things you can do and how
you may be viewed, in a similar manner to how a young girl may look like
a physical adult and be viewed in some ways---particularly sexually---as
an adult, but is still emotionally a child. Focus on how the changes in
the PCs' bodies make them feel different from their peers and even
different from their concept of themselves, as well as the harm they
unwillingly cause. This can be compounded by the normal teenage struggle
to be treated as an adult by their parents, especially if their emotions
got ahead of their control.

### Game Aspects

#### Modern

The School: a secluded boarding school might have [Forbidden
Rooms] and [Sadistic Teachers].

Rock Bottom: this private treatment center is a [Front for Scientific
Experiments] and is a place where [No One [[Will]] Help
You].

#### Sci Fi

Doing Time: a juvenile penal colony with the expectation of [Hard Work,
No Play] and [Predatory Guards].

Facecrime: a sanitized city where there are [Cameras
Everywhere] and [Strictly Enforced Behavioral Norms].

#### Fantasy

Moon's Blood: a magic user's school with [Tomes of Dark
Knowledge] and [Clueless Adults].

Drawing Down the Moon: a rural village with [Violent Bigotry]
and a [Room of Correction].

### Example Set Up

The PCs are fresh-faced new recruits to a magic user's school, excited
to be away from parental supervision. An older girl shows them the
ropes, and volunteers to room with one of the girls. She gives the PC
the [Bleed with Me] consequence, triggering the girl's
destructive power. The girl can spend a [[fate point]] to pass [Bleed with
Me] along to another female character or the [Boys Have It
Easier] consequence to a male character. [The Boys Have It
Easier] consequence can be compelled for obsessive, jealous,
and violent behavior.

#### Character Aspects

[Goddamned Force of Nature]: A character with this aspect
revels in their power, but is always on the edge of losing control and
hurting the ones closest to them.

[Mama's Little Girl]: A character with this aspect is torn
between their family's teachings and their true nature, and tragedy is
always be a possible consequence.

#### Stunts

**Blood Sisters:** When you use [[Rapport]] to [[Create Advantage]] on a
friendly NPC, gain an additional free invoke on the aspect you create,
even on a tie.

**The Devil Has Come Home:** Whenever you are in your own home, gain +2
to overcome fear or terror using [[Will]].

## Contagious Sexuality

Women carry the bulk of sexual consequences in the form of STIs,
pregnancy, and a disproportionate amount of violence, as well as the
strain of a sexual double standard and the conflicting media messages
between whore and good girl, slut and prude. It's almost like we think
female sexuality is contagious, infecting unwary men and innocent women
alike, and society tries to control it through these labels and
reminders of possible dire consequences. However, many women also find
power in their sexuality and how they express it; frequently society
deals with this empowerment by portraying them as predatory and
obsessive.

To incorporate the trope of dangerously contagious sexuality, you can
either go with the literal embodiment of frightening female
sexuality---gorgons, maenads, furies, and so forth---or you can take a
fear and turn it into a supernatural force. If there's a sexually
transmitted marker that attracts death, do the players try to stop
it---or do they seduce anyone bent on punishing their licentious ways,
thus turning the tables? You can enact a social stigma for promiscuous
PCs that follows those they spread their infection to, apply it to those
who aren't sexually active---or both! Focus on the juxtaposition between
sexuality and contagion.

### Game Aspects

#### Modern

Key Party: a wife-swapping soiree in a cheesy 70s ranch that contains a
[Skeezy Play Room] as well as some [Dangerous
Partners].

Drop Your Pants: A cold and impersonal STI clinic with an [Incompetent
Doctor] and [Defective Condoms].

#### Sci Fi

Tight Quarters: living on a space ship means [Nothing But Time to
Kill] and an [Unwelcome Stowaway].

The Excessive Machine: a planet dedicated to [Hedonistic
Pleasure] contains a [Hidden Dark Side].

#### Fantasy

Beautiful But Deadly: a training school for courtesans who double as
spies might [Push You to the Breaking Point] as well as have
[Easy Access to Weapons].

The Woods are Lovely, Dark and Deep: a forest filled with [Seductive
Fairies] who may have [Deadly Intentions].

### Example Set Up

The PCs are all normal people in an STI clinic, making small talk in the
reception room. The lights flicker overhead, making the receptionist
appear undead, and everything smells of bleach. One by one they're
called in to see the doctor, and one player is told they now have the
[Infected] consequence. When they share a moment of intimacy
with another character, they can spend a [[fate point]] to pass it on to
that character. While they have the consequence, you can compel them to
act on their baser impulses.

#### Character Aspects

[Virgin Next Door]: PCs who aren't sexually active might be
safe from being Infected, but it also means they're building up a lot of
steam without an outlet.

[Creature of Legend]: A PC could be any number of mythological
creatures that kill through sex or touch. This comes at a cost, as even
casual physical intimacy could harm or possibly kill friends and family.
In extreme cases, this could be something passed on to others, much like
an STI without a cure.

#### Stunts

**Latin for Teeth:** Once per conflict, you can spend a [[fate point]] to
add the aspect [Terrified] to anyone touching you by causing
them pain. [Terrified] disappears if someone successfully
inflicts stress on your character.

**Stranger in a Crowd:** People can feel your eyes boring into their
backs. Add+2 to [[Provoke]] attempts to inspire vague fear in someone in
your line of sight.

## [Monstrous ]Pregnancy

From Aliens to Rosemary's Baby, horror often features a strong fear of
being invaded, of harboring something wrong inside your own body. Take
Rosemary's Baby, for example---yes, Rosemary's horrified that her baby
might be the son of Satan, but first she experiences the horror of being
out of control of her own body, of things not being what she thought.
It's an outside fear that the protagonists face, something beyond
comprehension that has found its way inside.

There are obvious parallels to sexual assault that you should make sure
your players are okay with before introducing this kind of material.
It's perfectly fine to hand wave or choose a different route to show how
their character was "impregnated," as the focus here is on the
aftermath, not the inciting event. Movies frequently use dream sequences
that are fragmented and non-linear; you can do the same. It may also
have been an innocuous interaction with an alien or supernatural force
that infected the PC; no bodily stuff required.

Rather than going straight for demonspawn, start out by setting the
scene for subtle body horror as the characters experience things about
themselves that just don't seem right. Some examples would be a feeling
of shifting weight within their body, distorted reflections, clothes
that no longer fit, and unusual cravings. They don't have to be
pregnant, or even biologically capable of such a thing, to be carrying
some sort of alien parasite around, but pregnancy can serve as a model
for the ways in which the PCs' bodies seem to change.

Focus on the unnaturalness of the space that surrounds the characters
and crawls inside them.

### Game Aspects

#### Modern

Creepy Neighbors: your neighbors seem to be [There Every Time You Turn
Around] and they ask [Intrusive Questions].

The Housewife Syndrome: trapped all day in an apartment means [Time
Seems to Stand Still], but there are [Endless Chores]
as well.

#### Sci Fi

Study in Contrasts: the spaceship is `Sleek and Modern`, except
where `Dripping Organic Matter` intrudes.

Astronaut: the ship takes care of `Just Your Basic Needs`, but
much of it is `Unfriendly to Humans`.

#### Fantasy

God Has Forsaken This Place: the abandoned living quarters of nuns
contains `Dark Secrets` and `Unvoiced Pain`.

Goth As Fuck: a Gothic castle would have `Servant's Quarters`
as well as `Ghostly Inhabitants`.

### Example Set Up

The PCs all live in a run down apartment building in a bad part of town.
They can't explain the noises they hear or the actions of that creepy
old couple who live on the top floor, but one of the PCs has a horrible
nightmare and wakes up with an [Impregnated] consequence. When
they confess the alien pregnancy to another character, they can spend a
[[fate point]] to give the other player the consequence of [True
Believer]. While any of the PCs have this consequence, it can
be compelled to make the PC take dangerous risks in order to figure out
what's going on.

#### Character Aspects

[Almost Human]: This character will never be quite accepted or
trusted by the rest of the PCs, and their lack of physical weaknesses
may not make up for that. They also are unable to reproduce in
traditional ways, which can parallel infertile women, and may complicate
their feelings about harboring an alien parasite---or making sure
someone else does.

[Have My Father's Eyes]: If a character or NPC is descended
from Elder Gods, the Devil, or something equally squicky, they may be
powerful, yet unable to conceal their parentage and conflicted over
their true nature. While stories like Rosemary's Baby rely heavily on an
assumption that the maternal urge will override all other factors, this
could be an interesting exploration of the parent/child relationship,
particularly from the monstrous child's point of view.

#### Stunts

**Purity of Purpose:** Survival is what you're best at. Gain +2 to
[[Create Advantage]] using [[Crafts]] whenever you're stranded in a hostile
environment, like someone else's body.

**Get Away From Her, You Bitch:** Treat any success where you are
protecting your offspring as a success with style.

## Bringing Horror to Your Table

I've found that the best way to unsettle your players is to use the
things that you find horrifying and listen to their feedback. What
scares you will scare your players, if you focus on how the thing or
person makes you feel, rather than describing how it or they really are.
When I run a horror game, I pay strict attention to my players. If I
notice a nervous tick, like someone rubbing their earlobe, I know that
means they're feeling what I'm portraying. I also try to describe things
using all the senses; for example, people really freak out when they
touch something innocuous, like a couch, and find that it's warm,
slightly wet, and moving as if it were breathing. If you're describing a
bodily sensation, like the shifting weight from the Monstrous Pregnancy
or the first cramps in a game about Menarche, trying standing up and
showing with your posture and gestures how that feels. Lean in to your
players and speak quietly to create that intimate atmosphere that makes
up feminine horror.

Put your mind into the main villain's brainspace and really poke around
in there. If you figure out what they truly want and what motivates
them, you'll have a more convincing bad guy. All of your NPCs should
take actions based on their fears, hopes, and dreams. The alien parasite
in your Monstrous Pregnancy game has its own agenda---survival of the
species. That's a powerful drive, and it should be clear in all their
actions. A punitive antagonist for a Contagious Sexuality game has their
own reasons for hunting down and punishing those who have violated
sexual norms. What specific incident sparked your villain's design to
take up this mantle? Specificity makes for a more compelling NPC, and a
deep rooted belief makes for a threatening antagonist. Keep your players
off balance by creating spaces that should be safe but aren't, and
people they should be able to trust but can't.

Slow descriptions are also a great way to build dread---if you tell the
players that it's dark in the room, they'll just try to figure out a way
to get light in there. But if you tell them the light is dim and they
think they see something in the corner---something big enough to be a
person but it's not moving---the player will first worry about what
exactly is in the corner and whether they want to see it, rather than
worrying about the mechanics of light.

But remember that no matter how much you build the horror in your game,
there will always be someone you can't creep out, and laughter is a
common response to being uncomfortable or scared. Because horror is so
personal, make sure to communicate with your players, and have fun
terrifying each other!
