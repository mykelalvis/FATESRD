# Campaign Season

_by Andr√© La Roche_

So. You want to change the world. War for a vacant throne? Pass
legislation to protect us from the metahuman menace known as
"superheroes"? Run for president of the galactic colonies? Or maybe you
pretend to be an "aw shucks" good ol' boy in Congress who only craves
power. If you want nations to listen to your voice, or just those in
smoke-filled back rooms, it sounds like you're ready to begin the
**Campaign Season**.

## Defining a Campaign

A **Campaign** uses the **Fate fractal**---the idea that anything in
Fate can be treated as a character with skills, aspects, stress track,
and stunts---to chart the success of players whose characters are elite
political operatives; it measures how successful players are in changing
public opinion.

A Campaign represents an overarching social mission that the players
struggle to achieve in response to the game's **Big Issues** (page 22 of
[[Fate Core]] System), and the group decides what kind of coordinated
efforts it represents. Is it passing legislation? Is it a treaty
negotiation at a political summit? Is it running an election, while
rigging an ambassadorial appointment? Tracking the tide of a war of
succession? Coordinating a bake sale?

Players can be embroiled in multiple Campaigns at once. New Campaigns
emerge through play when the group agrees that story advancements render
it appropriate. In fact, it's ideal to have different Campaigns that the
players shuttle between, weaving different agendas in and out of focus.

## Game Creation Guidelines

During game creation, the GM and players should discuss the initial
Campaigns that the PCs will engage in. Do the PCs collaborate on the
same Campaign, or are they elite operatives working on behalf of
competing Campaigns at cross-purposes? For more in-depth advice on the
game creation session, see Leonard Balsera's Game Creation Tips:
Managing the Conversation in The Fate Codex, Volume 1, Issue 1.

### Are the Campaign Rules Even Warranted?

The first question to answer is whether the players want their approach
to solving the game's Big Issues to even require building a Campaign.
Theoretically, every game could use these rules to model player progress
in confronting the game's Big Issues. That would be wasteful, though.
The Campaign rules really shine when the players want their characters
to be close to the ebb and flow of public opinion, to really see the
effects of their victories and failures play out across society. While a
heroic group of adventurers will certainly affect the world over the
course of their career, reminders of their larger influence will be
sporadic. They aren't steeped in the daily society-wide measures of
their actions the way that a lobbyist, small-town mayor, or ambitious
prince is.

### Scope of Politics

How political do you want the game to be? First and foremost, a Fate
game is supposed to be fun for everyone at the table. Inherently
political games run the risk of pushing people into uncomfortable
emotional terrain, but then again, maybe that's precisely what everyone
at the table wants. The game creation session is a vital time for
everyone to speak up and say what issues they consider off the table, or
at least want to be treated with respect, not lampooned. We're all
friends here at the table, so make sure it's a fulfilling experience for
everyone.

In games focusing on politics of medieval succession, the overarching
political issues are likely so abstract from present issues that there's
little risk of pushing other players' emotional buttons. However, even
something as fantastic as "metahuman registration" can devolve into
thinly-veiled mimicry of real-world politics. Be aware of each other's
lines, and be forgiving if someone crosses your lines---it likely wasn't
intentional. A little respect and forgiveness goes a long way. Feel free
to revisit this conversation as things progress.

In modern political games, it's tempting to use knowledge of policy and
legislation to add detail to the process. A little amount of detail is
nice, e.g., "This bill will help national parks at the expense of
teachers!" but the more detailed you get, the more you're likely to lose
the attention of players who aren't politics junkies. It's best to
develop just a few ideas of who a bill helps or hurts and how.

### Fractal Play

So how do you make the Campaign rules complement, rather than
overshadow, individual characters? One way to do this is to have players
roleplay their individual missions and objectives as the key to
unlocking certain Campaign rolls.

Your Campaign can't attack using its Publicize skill until the player
characters have found a new communications director to replace the
suspiciously missing one. Likewise, your players will need to be
successful in using their [[Provoke]] and [[Rapport]] skills to rally protestors
within the community before your Campaign can attack using its Mobilize
skill. Or perhaps that `Grand Banquet] you hope to throw using
Funding requires you to perform a few personal favors for major donors.

Think of it this way: player missions represent the core events that set
the Campaign's public actions into motion.

## Initial Campaign Creation

The initial Campaign is created during game creation by the GM and
players. As in-game events result in the creation of new Campaigns, the
GM can either create the write-up of those Campaigns, or delegate it to
the players to do between sessions and approve it at the start of the
next game session---whatever works best for your group.

Campaigns are written up much like characters.

### Name the Campaign

The Campaign name, though not an aspect, is a way of tracking what a
Campaign is focused on achieving. Examples include "Colonial
Presidency," "Stack the Deck," and "Nimby." `See below](#Anchor-1) for
full write-ups of these examples.

### Create Campaign Aspects

**Framing Aspect:** Much like the high concept for characters, the
framing aspect is the overarching direction of the Campaign---the
rallying cry of the faithful. Examples include `Colonies
United!], `Everyone's a Stepping Stone], or `We Don't
Want It!]

**Counterframe Aspect:** Much like the trouble aspect for characters,
the counterframe aspect represents the inherent and obvious weaknesses
of a Campaign. Examples include, `Time Is Ripe for
Independence], `Circular Firing Squad], or `Just a Wee
Bit ]`Overreactionary].

**Other Aspects:** Like character creation, each player takes turns
creating an aspect for the Campaign and explaining its significance. The
group determines how many additional aspects are needed, based on how
large and far-reaching the Campaign is.

### Influence Stress

Each Campaign has a stress track which measures _**influence stress**_.
The influence stress track represents how your Campaign is weathering
the slings and arrows of the opposition in the eyes of the public.
Influence stress can be affected by the actions of other Campaigns or of
individuals. Each Campaign starts out with one stress box, plus one
stress box per Campaign aspect. Influence stress works just like a
character's physical and mental stress track with one giant caveat: it
can never heal unless the Campaign possesses the Damage Control stunt.
The news cycle and public opinion are unforgiving.

### Campaign Consequences

Like character consequences, each Campaign has a -2, -4, and -6 slot.
Just like consequences suffered by characters, these can soak up stress.
As with influence stress, Campaign consequences don't heal.

### Campaign Skills

Campaigns all share the same four skills (`see below](#Anchor-2)), and
players decide together how to rank each skill along the following
levels of the skill ladder with one skill per ladder rung: Average (+1),
Fair (+2), Good (+3), Great (+4).

### Skill Timing

Discuss whether a Campaign can use its skills once per scene, or once
per milestone (minimum of once per session, or more frequently if
multiple milestones occur in a session). Campaigns designed to be brief
and span days or weeks (bake sale, treaty summit) should allow rolls
once per scene. Campaigns designed to be extended and last months or
years (presidential election, wars) should allow rolls once per
milestone.

### Fate Points

Campaigns have no [[fate point]]s. Characters who work on Campaigns can use
their own [[fate point]]s to affect Campaigns.

### Campaign Stunts

Each campaign has three stunts, chosen from the list following.### Single Campaign game

The default assumption is that eventually multiple Campaigns will be in
play at any given time, fighting and competing against one another. If
you want to streamline this, it's easy to track only the Campaign that
the players support. Using this option, the players' Campaign can be
harmed directly by NPCs. Instead of having opposing Campaigns attack,
have attack and defense rolls be made by key NPCs using the skill that
makes the most sense.

A middle ground is to use the Nimby Campaign provided below. The Nimby
Campaign is designed to provide general opposition to just about
anything. Just rename it to "Space Invasion," "Concerned PTA," "Majority
Political Party," or whatever represents the opposed interests.## `Campaign Skills]

All Campaigns have the same four skills: Funding, Mobilize, Publicize,
and Subterfuge. A Campaign can use its skills to affect the social mood
and people's conventional wisdom surrounding the Big Issues.

Advantages created by Campaigns are powerful and, depending upon skill
timing, last until the next scene or milestone. A Campaign can make one
attack per scene or milestone, in accordance with its skill timing.## Funding

This skill represents the Campaign's material resources. It could be a
king's horde, galactic credits, shells, drachma---whatever the currency,
this skill represents how much your Campaign wields.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Like the [[Resources]] skill, Funding allows Campaigns to
purchase solutions to problems.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: You use Funding to create advantages that
reflect pouring money into local economies (`A Turkey in Every
Oven]) or use conspicuous displays of wealth to impress
supporters and the public (`Grand Banquet]). You can also use
Funding to declare that your Campaign has something on hand, or to
acquire it quickly.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Funding isn't used for attacks.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Funding isn't used to defend.

## Mobilize

This skill represents the raw physical power of a Campaign's believers
and operatives. It could represent highly-paid attorneys, skilled
operatives, grassroots volunteers, or trained armies.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Your Campaign can overcome obstacles related to mobilizing
its operatives such as canvassing a neighborhood, protesting an event,
or organizing a bake sale. Opposed Campaigns use their own Mobilize
skill to resist this roll.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Use this skill to create advantages related to
your ability to mobilize your followers such as `Power to the
People], `Angry Mob], or `Disciplined Army].

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Mobilize can be rolled to represent the combined might of
your followers attacking another Campaign by canvassing, coordinating
staffer efforts, lawsuits, or good ol' fashioned fisticuffs.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: You can use Mobilize to defend against attacks made by other
Campaigns using the Mobilize skill.

## Publicize

This skill represents a Campaign's ability to spread its message
effectively. It could utilize media, runners, and town criers, or an
informal web of gossip and rumors.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: You can spread messages that are harmful to your enemies
or helpful to your Campaign. You can inspire or terrify the public with
your message. Enemy Campaigns oppose with Subterfuge.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: You can create advantages that reflect public
opinion such as `Shocked], `Inspired], or
`Rebellious].

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Publicize can be used to attack a rival campaign's
influence stress.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Using the media is just as crucial for defending as it is
for attacking. This skill can be used to defend against attacks made by
another Campaign's Publicize skill.

## Subterfuge

This skill represents the Campaign's ability to manipulate
behind-the-scenes events. These are the unsavory actions that Campaigns
take that they typically don't want known.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: Use Subterfuge so that your Campaign can bypass situations
in sneaky or underhanded ways, such as snooping through the opposition's
private documents, hacking computer systems, embedding spies, or
engaging in blackmail.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: Subterfuge can be used to create advantages
that reflect some sort of hidden benefit such as Shapeshifter Agents,
Trojan Horse Virus, or Bribed Official.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Subterfuge itself isn't used to attack, but to position your
people to make the most effective attacks.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: Subterfuge can be used defensively against Publicize
attacks, as you bury unfavorable stories beneath blustery arguments and
distractions.## `Campaign Stunts]

Campaigns choose three of the following stunts. Characters can take
these stunts too, granting their ability to any Campaigns they work on.
This represents the characters' status as highly-valued and coveted
Campaign operatives.

**Beacon of Hope:** The Campaign radiates inspiration for a more
prosperous future. The Campaign gains an extra free invoke when using
Publicize or Funding to create advantages premised on a better future
such as `Plan for Prosperity], `I [[Will]] End This War],
or `A Golden Age Is Near].

**Damage Control:** The Campaign is exceptionally resilient. Once per
scene or milestone (based on the Campaign's skill timing), one of its
operatives can spend a [[fate point]] to clear one box of influence stress.

**Scandal!:** The Campaign is ruthless about exploiting damaging
information---love affairs, buried secrets, or hidden hypocrisies. When
attacking by highlighting an opposing Campaign's scandalous or hidden
information, you deal an extra [[shift]] of influence stress.

**Work the News:** The Campaign is exceptionally connected to the media,
and knows how to broadcast its message. This stunt grants +2 to
Publicize when spreading the Campaign's message. This bonus can be used
on Subterfuge rolls by Campaigns with the Friends in Low Places stunt.

**Friends in Low Places:** This Campaign has connections it would rather
not publicize. Perhaps those connections are with criminal
organizations, or incredibly unpopular figures. Either way, those
connections grant the Campaign the ability to work in unconventional
ways. You can use Subterfuge to attack as though it were Publicize.

**Pig-Headed:** This Campaign won't go down without a fight. It gains
two extra influence stress boxes. Individual characters who take this
stunt grant only one Campaign they're working on at a time the two
additional stress boxes.

## Battling Campaigns

Campaigns attack each other using relevant skill rolls. However,
Campaign combat works slightly differently than character combat.

### Effect of Being Taken Out

As with characters, if an attack reduces all of the Campaign's stress
and the Campaign has no more consequences, it's taken out. Being taken
out always ends the Campaign. Being taken out can either result in the
complete loss of the Campaign, a compromised success (such as a bill
containing poison pill provisions, an army claiming the throne with
tenuous power to maintain it, etc.), or a victorious campaign with an
overwhelmingly disapproving society (space invaders establishing an
empire that's challenged by rebel forces.)

Unlike characters, Campaigns are designed to be finite creations. It's
easier for a Campaign to be taken out---and taken out for good---than
for a character. That's why Campaigns don't heal stress or consequences.
They may be able to last a little longer with the Damage Control stunt,
but ultimately every Campaign will end. This means that, logically
speaking, even a victorious Campaign ceases to exist once its opponent
has been defeated. Every election has a voting day, every treaty gets
passed or talks stall out, every war ends, and every small-town rumor
campaign explodes into a public spectacle.

That's why it's important to create new Campaigns throughout the course
of play. The easiest way to do this is to create new Campaigns when the
Big Issues of the game change. Sure, the Metahuman Registration Act has
passed, but now we must Appoint the Director of Metahuman Affairs. While
Aleck may have succeeded in acquiring the throne, he must now Restore
Law to the Land even as he is opposed by a Wave of Bandit Raiders.

Every new story comes from some other story's end.

### Conceding

A Campaign can concede, but like being taken out, that ends the
Campaign. A concession can result in incredibly favorable compromises
such as being chosen as the opponent's running mate, proposed spin-off
legislation, or restoring peace to the kingdom at the cost of your
throne. +

## Sample Campaign Writeups## Colonial Presidency

It's that time of the orbital cycle again: the political war for the
most important position in the galaxy! All sides are vying for the
position, and Galactic Gambling Mogul Kami Shaddad has thrown her hat
into the ring, hyperdriving across the colonies, working her charm,
flashing smiles, and promising the Interplanetary Trade Commission all
of the support it wants.

## Stack the Deck

Politics is a deadly game. Sometimes doing everything you can to get
your party's voting bloc into the majority, and your own star on the
rise, requires bloodying noses and burying bodies---literally. Today's
casualties pave the way for tomorrow's leaders.

## Nimby

The Nimby are a fearsome people. They will stop at nothing to halt your
Campaign, no matter how righteous and just. The Nimby never listen to
reason, nor can they see the future clearly or respect a treasured past.
It should be obvious to the Nimby that your cause will only help their
long-term goals, but they'll hear nothing of it. The Nimby are in every
society, and every reality, and are cunning enough to infiltrate your
own causes. They could be anyone, anywhere: villagers with pitchforks,
righteous protestors, landed gentry, a faceless goon squad, or a PTA
comprised of helicopter parents.
