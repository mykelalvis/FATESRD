# Rethinking [[Stealth]]

_by koji nishiuchi_

[[

[[Stealth]] comes up a lot in just about every kind of adventure. Whether
it's a costumed vigilante lurking in the rafters before a flashy
entrance or a terrified teen hiding in the closet from the supernatural
serial killer, there are times when the question "Can they see me or
not?" becomes vitally important. [[Stealth]] is common in RPGs, too---just
about every system with a list of skills has at least one focused on
stealth.

## The Problems of [[Stealth]]

In roleplaying games, stealth almost always works the same way: you roll
how well you can hide against how well your opposition can spot you, and
if you fail, you're found. It's a simple rule, and at first glance it
seems to intuitively capture how hiding works in fiction. The problem is
what happens when you put those rules into practice.

### Pass or Fail?

The first time you fail a [[Stealth]] roll, you've failed the whole stealth
mission. That's because once you're spotted, it's no longer a stealth
mission. It's either back to combat as you fight your way through, or a
chase scene as you run away. Since you generally only use stealth when
it's needed---to avoid a lethal encounter or big social
consequences---this failure can range from disastrous to deadly.

Because the consequences of failure are so drastic, if you want to use
stealth, you need a high [[Stealth]] rank. While it's perfectly acceptable
to go into combat with a 50% chance of hitting and a 50% chance of being
hit, attempting a [[Stealth]] roll with just a 50% chance of success is
crazy. It gets even worse when you're called upon to make multiple rolls
at multiple checkpoints against multiple guards while sneaking. Because
it only takes one failure to ruin everything, using stealth is heavily
punished if you can't reliably---almost trivially---succeed at all
times. Even if your character has Great (+4) [[Stealth]] and is only up
against guards with Fair (+2) [[Notice]], by the third roll you'll have an
88% chance of failing without dipping into your precious reserve of fate
points.

But what if your character has a stunt gives them a reliable +2 bonus to
their check? What if it's +6 against the measly +2? Then you run into
another problem: If you _can_ succeed every time, there's no tension or
challenge. If you _can't_ succeed almost every time, trying to sneak
around is likely to cause more trouble than it's worth. While that
all-or-nothing approach might work for some, there should be a middle
ground.

### Solo [[Stealth]]

Beyond the all-or-nothing nature of stealth, there's another fundamental
problem: because stealth is the domain of the expert, non-experts get
left behind. When the thief scouts ahead, they get cut off from the
party, and if they do get spotted, they're in a whole bunch of trouble.
Meanwhile, the other PCs need to...wait---possibly for a whole session.
Alternatively, a GM might actively discourage stealth, whether by
shaping the adventure to not need stealth, or by making the risks too
high, the rewards too low, or the odds too stacked against the stealth
expert's favor, punishing them for their investment in the skill.

Now, it could very well be that a GM wants to punish stealth. Maybe
stealth doesn't fit the kind of game they're interested in running.
Maybe they're more a fan of big action pieces or social drama, where
stealth is out of place because it's much quieter and solitary by
nature.

This is a false choice, though. Giving power and utility to stealth need
not also make it time-consuming and unbalanced. So when a GM wants to
allow a player to be stealthy, but at the same time they don't want that
player to hog the spotlight, they have options.

## Making [[Stealth]] Work

These problems aren't new. They've been around from the beginning of
tabletop RPGs, appearing in system after system, accepted as just the
way things go because most RPGs don't have the tools to tackle the
problem at its core. In such games, by trying to emulate reality, it's a
challenge to represent stealth in a satisfying way. Simulating stealth
can be an even greater challenge than simulating combat, though. You
have to consider lines of sight, the ambient lighting, the abilities and
skills of every single NPC in your path, and more.

Fate isn't like other RPGs, though---it does have the tools to make
stealth worthwhile. Since Fate is all about emulating fiction, not
reality, we can think about how stealth fits into stories.

In fiction, stealth tends to be used in two distinct ways. At one end of
the spectrum, there is slinking through the shadows, climbing among the
rafters, and slowly slipping past detection. At the other, you have
dodging just out of someone's field of vision, throwing down a smoke
bomb to hide in the fog, jumping out of the shadows and retreating back
in, or taking the chance to run for your life. We'll call these,
respectively, Sneaking and Hiding. These aren't new skills, but they
will let you use the [[Stealth]] skill in new ways.

## Sneaking

Actions in Fate can be split into two categories: **quick actions** and
**long actions**. Quick actions are things like attacking a monster,
jumping a chasm, or noticing a trap. They happen more or less in real
time. Long actions are things like researching an ancient cult, finding
a buyer for a highly illegal magical artifact, or combing a crime scene
for clues. They can take minutes, hours, or even days to complete.
Often, players will focus on the quick. They'll say they want to do
something, roll the dice, and then it's done. Longer things are thought
to be more boring, the kind of "downtime" events that go on between
adventures, like crafting magical items or learning new languages.

[[Stealth]] is generally a quick action. You hide and move silently while
hoping not to be seen. But you can also use stealth as a long
action---Sneaking. Like other long actions, Sneaking can take minutes or
hours to complete, as your character carefully studies the environment,
analyzes patterns, and only moves at the absolute safest moments. In
exchange for taking up extra time from the character's perspective,
Sneaking is generally safer and, perhaps paradoxically, much faster for
the players than standard [[Stealth]]. That's because while the normal
[[Stealth]] approach has you go through every obstacle and encounter on its
own, the Sneaking approach can boil it all down to a single check.

When you make a normal [[Stealth]] roll as a quick action, it's opposed by
the [[Notice]] ranks of any would-be observers. With Sneaking, you roll only
once against a passive difficulty. Say a player wants to scout an orc
war camp. If you run the conflict like a typical roleplaying game, the
player might need to succeed on many overcome rolls to slip past
multiple sentries, succeed on some more against lower difficulty to get
past off-duty warriors, and do it all over again on the way out. A
single failed roll will lead to them being surrounded and outmatched in
a deadly situation. Though from the character's perspective they might
be done in just a few minutes, it could take upwards of an hour for the
player and GM to run this solo mini-session.

A Sneaking roll condenses all this into a single create an advantage
roll, with success revealing useful aspects about the war camp. Failure
would mean the character can't find a way to sneak into the camp, but
wouldn't alert the camp to their presence; success at a major cost could
be the very opposite, getting them the info, but just as they're
slipping away a twist of fate has them spotted and then chased all the
way back to the party. From the character's perspective, the act of
Sneaking could take three hours or more, but from the player's
perspective, it's a brief conversation with the GM lasting a few minutes
at most that moves the fiction along quickly.

## Hiding

If Sneaking is the long-form version of [[Stealth]], Hiding is
moment-by-moment evasion. Hiding most often comes up in two situations:
when a PC has been spotted and wants to regain their hidden position,
and in combat when a PC wants some concealment for just long enough to
launch a sneak attack. The biggest difference between Hiding rolls and
other kinds of [[Stealth]] rolls is that a player only uses Hiding when
someone is already aware of their presence and is actively looking for
them.

Like Sneaking, Hiding is a [[create advantage]] roll. When you want to
hide, roll [[Stealth]] against the highest [[Notice]] of the opposition. On a
success, your character gains a [Hidden] [[situation aspect]] to
describe their success at avoiding detection. Like with other situation
aspects, you can invoke these [Hidden] aspects to improve your
attack and defense rolls. It can also provide +2 passive opposition to
attacks as you make yourself a difficult target. This passive opposition
doesn't stack with a character's skills for defense rolls, though, so if
a player has a higher-ranked defensive skill, such as [[Athletics]] or
[[Fight]], they'll want to roll with the skill instead of relying on the
passive opposition.

While [Hidden], a player can create an advantage, opposed by
the opposition's highest [[Notice]], to place additional free invokes on
their [Hidden] aspect. The player can then offer compels to the
GM on that [Hidden] aspect so that they can safely escape.
Persistent pursuers might want to resist the compel, spending one fate
point per free invoke on the aspect. This integrates [[Stealth]] with the
standard rules of conflicts without boiling things down to a single
check at one end or forcing players to concede in order to escape at the
other.

The [Hidden] aspect, just like any other [[situation aspect]], is
not a blanket permission to ignore all the other characters. An enemy
can still attack after they've been [Blinded] or
[Stunned], and a PC can still be attacked even though they are
Hidden. The player can invoke the aspect turn a hit into a miss with the
+2 bonus---because, naturally, it's more difficult to attack someone who
is hiding from you---or offer their opposition a compel to get away from
danger, but they are otherwise just as vulnerable as anyone else.

You may wonder, doesn't it make more sense that a [Hidden]
aspect must be overcome before a PC can be attacked? For two reasons,
no. First, consider the kind of scene that comes up when someone uses
stealth in a fight: weaving in and out of smoke, fog, or shadows for
strikes, all while the opponent lashes out constantly, trying
desperately to predict where the next attack will come from. Sometimes,
with enough battle instinct, they land a blow on their stealthy
opponent.

Second, and of even greater importance, is that if the [Hidden]
can generally only be overcome with a single skill ([[Notice]]), the balance
of the game breaks. Badly. Characters with low [[Notice]] would be nearly
helpless against even moderately stealthy enemies. And while it might be
fun letting someone get away with being invincible, that kind of power
can offer perverse incentives, incentives the players might end up
pursuing even if it goes against their character concepts or the fun of
the game.

## Final Thoughts

Neither Sneaking nor Hiding is a new rule. They're just two different
approaches to using the basic rules of [[Fate Core]]. The advice is also
very general, suited more for games where stealth is one factor among
many rather than the most important element. In a game about thieves or
ninjas, it can be fine to zoom in on each stealthy encounter and treat a
high [[Stealth]] rank as an absolutely broken advantage in combat. And in a
game of adventurers, if one player can alter reality on a whim while
another can wrestle a handful of demigods at a time, it would be less of
a problem for the rogue's [Hidden] aspect to make them nigh
invincible.

It's up to a GM to pick the best tools for the job at hand. The goal
here is simply to sharpen a few of those tools.

### Bonus Stunts

If you do use these guidelines, it can be helpful to have a few stunts
on hand for players to customize their approach to stealth with. They're
only examples, though: just like anything else in Fate, you can use them
as they are or as inspiration for designing your own.

Quick Scout. +2 to [[Stealth]] when used for scouting and reconnaissance,
and when you succeed with style on such tasks, you finish in a fifth the
normal time it would take.

Careful Scout. +2 to [[Stealth]] when used for infiltration and thwarting
security attempts. If you fail, you can try again, but the second
attempt takes twice as long.

Infiltrator. +2 to [[Stealth]] while hiding in plain sight, disguised as an
evil henchperson, hapless low-level employee, mindless zombie, or
something similar, as long as you aren't recognized.

Backstabber. Once per session, gain +2 to attack an enemy while you are
[Hidden].

Absconder. +1 when using [[Stealth]] to defend against [[Notice]]. Also, if you
compel an opponent with your [Hidden] aspect to allow you to
escape, they must spend 2 [[fate point]]s to resist it.

Getaway Planner. When you compel your [Hidden] aspect to escape
from a conflict, you can take others with you. For each [[fate point]]
beyond the first added to the compel, whether by you or another party
member, you can take someone else. +
