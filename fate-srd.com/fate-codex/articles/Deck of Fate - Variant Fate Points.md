# Deck of Fate: Variant Fate Points

by [[Mark Diaz Truman]]

Nearly every Fate designer I know has spent time trying to assign values
to aspects instead of a flat +2 per [[fate point]] spent. It seems like it
should be easy to diversify aspect ratings, but attempts to create tiers
of aspects usually end up wrecking the tightly constructed system of
invokes and compels that makes Fate fun. Tiered aspects are a white
whale of Fate design, often hunted but never captured.

Instead of changing aspects, what if we change how [[fate point]]s work? In
this systems piece, I'll show you how to use the Deck of Fate (and
normal Fate dice) to vary the strength of [[fate point]]s without
sacrificing the Fate economy. These variant [[fate point]]s aren't quite
tiered aspects, but they will create new variety in your Fate stories
without a lot of bookkeeping or hassle by making use of the Deck of
Fate.

## Fate Cards as Fate Points

Instead of passing out tokens at the beginning of the session, hand out
fate cards from the Deck of Fate. Characters with a refresh of 3, for
example, should take three fate cards from the Deck of Fate. Hold these
cards like a hand in poker; don't show anyone what you've got and try
not to give yourself away if you draw something solid. Throughout the
session, you can use these fate cards to invoke and compel aspects as if
they were [[fate point]]s... with some fun new tricks.

There's a few rules we have to put in place to make fate cards work:

- **You've got to keep your hand secret.** If players discuss their
  hands with each other, talking about the fate cards becomes the
  focus of play. You can obliquely refer to your cards---"I think I've
  got a strong hand."---but don't say anything concrete like "I have a
  +3 fate card."
- **You can only play fate cards when you can spend [[fate point]]s.** The
  cards are replacing [[fate point]]s, so you can spend them only when you
  would normally spend a [[fate point]]: when you're rolling against
  passive or active opposition or when another character is rolling
  against passive opposition.
- **Reshuffle and redraw when someone plays a +4 or -4.** Over the
  course of an entire session of Fate, it's pretty easy to count cards
  from the deck if you don't reshuffle and redraw. Refresh the deck by
  collecting everyone's hand, reshuffling all the cards, and redrawing
  whenever someone plays a +4 or -4 fate card.

## Invoking Aspects with Fate Cards

Playing fate cards to invoke an aspect works like a normal invoke---you
declare that you're invoking an aspect that's appropriate for the
situation and play the card---but they have some new effects. You can
play as many fate cards as you want, just as you can spend as many fate
points as you want, but any cards played are used up once they leave
your hand.

### Variant Invokes

When you invoke an aspect by playing a fate card, add the number on the
fate card to your total, your opponent's total (against you or a passive
opposition), or passive opposition instead of adding +2. Positive cards
add [[shift]]s to the total; negative cards remove [[shift]]s from the total.
(Hint: you'll probably want to play the negative cards on your opponent
or passive opposition!)

Sometimes this means that your invoke is worth the same or less than a
normal invoke (+1 or +2 [[shift]]s), but it can also mean that your invoke
makes a task more challenging for an opponent (negative cards) or has an
extra powerful effect (+3 or +4 [[shift]]s). When you play these variants,
narrate how the aspect is keeping your opponent from making progress or
having an intense or severe effect.

> Marissa and Justin are space pirates hijacking a Revellian trade ship.
> While trying to leap from ship to ship, Justin's character, Merlavik,
> comes up short on his roll against a Great (+4) difficulty. Since he's
> got a pretty low [[Athletics]], he only got a Mediocre (+0) result. Justin
> has a few cards in his hand, but nothing above a +1. He plays one of
> them to invoke his `Hard to Kill] aspect to raise his roll to
> Average (+2) and narrates how Merlavik grabs on to the edge of the
> ship to keep from flying into space.
>
> Luckily, Marissa has a better hand. Her character, Alleea, is the
> heavy hitter in the crew, and she's got the +4 card that's going to
> save Merlavik's life. She plays the card to invoke her `All Eyes
> Open] and add +4 to Justin's roll against the passive
> opposition, bringing him to a Superb (+5) result. She narrates that
> she sees him barely grab on to the ship, and reaches out into space to
> pull him in before anyone can see him. Since she played the +4 fate
> card, the GM collects all the cards, reshuffles the deck, and passes
> new cards out to everyone.

### Invoking for a Reroll

Of course, the +0 cards don't do much as variant invokes. It's not
helpful to spend a fate card to add nothing to your roll! Instead of
using +0 cards to add or subtract [[shift]]s from a roll, use +0 cards to
invoke aspects to trigger rerolls. You can only trigger a reroll if you
rolled the dice; you can't spend them to make someone else reroll.

> When they are about to take the ship, Justin realizes that Alleea is
> actually planning to kill the rival captain to get revenge for some
> past wrongs. When she starts to blast through the security doors
> instead of stealing the cargo---rolling -2 on her dice for a total of
> Good (+3) against a Fair (+2) difficulty---he decides to invoke `Eyes
> on the Prize] by playing his -3 card. Merlavik yells at
> Alleea to keep moving toward the cargo, distracting her at the crucial
> moment.
>
> Marissa's still got options. She decides to play one of her own
> cards... but she's only got three +0 fate cards left. She plays one to
> reroll, invoking `Never Forgive, Never Forget] to reroll her
> dice. She comes up with a +3 on the dice, shifting her total to a
> success with style! She blasts through the door; Merlavik knows she
> won't be stopped now.### Looser Invokes

If you want a crazy and wild game of Fate, let everyone play cards to
invoke aspects at any time. It won't break the game, but it will mean
that players will play cards as often as they can, burning through fate
cards quickly and challenging every result. If you do this, however,
players will need to accept a lot more compels to collect enough fate
cards to keep up the pace.## Free Invokes

When you use a [[Create Advantage]] roll to create a new aspect with free
invokes---or add free invokes to an existing aspect---draw a number of
cards to your hand from the Deck of Fate equal to the number of free
invokes you create. Place that number of cards from your hand face up
next to the aspect you just created or improved, **banking** those cards
into that aspect. These cards are safe from reshuffling. When you use
the free invokes from that aspect, play one of the cards you banked.

Your allies can use banked cards as well, so bank strong cards if you
think someone else can make better use of them than you can. Since you
can't reveal your hand, creating advantages allows you and your allies
to coordinate spending your best fate cards. In addition, banked cards
don't get reshuffled, so you can save a card you want for later by
banking it!

> Once Alleea breaks through the door, she orders Merlavik to fan out to
> catch the captain. She makes a Command roll to create the advantage
> `Imperial Tactics ]based on her former assassin training. She
> succeeds with style, drawing two fate cards into her hand, one for
> each free invoke she earned on the aspect. She decides to bank one of
> her new cards worth -3 and one of her old +0 cards into the aspect.
> She can use them anytime she can use a free invoke or pass them over
> to Justin so that Merlavik can use them too. She gets to keep the
> other card she drew in her hand.

## Compels, Story Details, and Stunts

You can use a fate card for anything else that you can use a [[fate point]]
for in [[Fate Core]], including offering compels, adding story details, or
activating stunts. Just discard the card face up---revealing whatever
you had on the card---and activate the compel, detail, or stunt as
normal. You'll probably use a lot of weaker cards this way, although you
might have to sacrifice a strong card if you're in a tough spot.### For the GM

What about the GM? Well... the GM gets fate cards that can be used for
invokes as well. At the beginning of each scene, the GM gets to draw a
number of cards equal to the number of players in the game. The GM can
use these fate cards the same way players can, invoking aspects and
modifying rolls. The GM can also offer fate cards from the top of the
deck as compels, just as if the cards were regular [[fate point]]s.## Fate with Variance

The goal of variant [[fate point]]s is to give aspects some new depth and
variety, creating that moment when a special feature of your character
makes all the difference in the world. It suits settings where big
changes in momentum are fun---like space opera---and gives players new
ways to use [[Create Advantage]] to work together. At the same time, it
retains the key parts of Fate that matter to a coherent story, and it
will challenge your group to continue to add narrative detail every time
a card is played. I hope you enjoy it at your table!
