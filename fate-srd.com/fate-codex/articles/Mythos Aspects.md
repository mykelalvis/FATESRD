# Mythos Aspects

## EXPRESSING SOURCE MATERIAL WITH PREGENERATED ASPECTS

by JUNE SHORES

Mythos is a concept in TV production, a catch-all word for things like
phrases, formula, and motifs that define the aesthetic of a TV show.
Battle cries like "It's morphin' time!" and setting elements like The
Brotherhood of Evil Mutants are examples of mythos in their particular
franchise. You might have heard about a similar concept in the Lovecraft
mythos, which encompasses Cthulhu and other Elder Gods.

When you sit down to play, say a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles campaign,
each player comes with different experiences of the mythos that will
inform how they approach the setting. An old-timer who only ever saw the
children's cartoon show when they were small is going to bring very
different ideas from the twenty-four-year-old who grew up on the movies
and recently did a marathon read of the original, grim-'n'-gritty Mirage
comic books. These approaches can clash and create dissonance and even
arguments at the table about what is appropriate for a campaign. This
problem can be overcome with a thorough game-creation session, but
running one often takes a long time. Working through things together is
great! It's often necessary for players to take some time to hash out
what a Fate game is going to look like. But sometimes you want to get
everybody on the same page about the aesthetics of a game without taking
up a session or more. Sometimes, you want to eliminate blank-page
paralysis and get things moving.

In this piece, I'll show you how to use mythos to your advantage, giving
your players solid ground on which to build their characters and letting
them know what to expect from the world, by doing these things:

- Writing up a handful of setting and character **aspects** beforehand
  will help the players focus on the content the game should include.
- Giving these aspects **specific details** will make them more
  concrete in the players' heads, encouraging them to get to scenes
  faster.
- Asking the players **pointed questions** about these details will
  include them intheprocesswithoutsacrificingmomentum.

Making these aspects part of character and game creation can help you to
connect the players to the mythos in a big way without needing to take
hours to get on the same page. The sort of content that you include in
these details and questions will communicate the tone and focus of the
campaign.

## SETTING ASPECTS

Look at your premise and your genre. What do they look like? What are
the iconic, recurring images that come to mind? If you're trying to
emulate something, like Star Wars or X-Men, revisit the source material
and examine what makes it feel authentic. What are the big ideas and
aesthetic stylings that make it feel like that galaxy far, far away?
What works to bring the setting to life, and how can you use that in
your campaign? Write these details down. Look for common themes and
group them together.

### Creating Setting Aspects

Once you have some ideas for the aesthetic underpinnings of your game,
you'll want to turn them into aspects. Some themes are obvious and
iconic---the X-Men's struggle against prejudice, for example, is often
expressed by [A World That Hates and Fears Them]. Other themes
are much smaller or rely on other themes to communicate their whole
meaning---Star Wars aliens, worlds, and space ships are all wonderfully
diverse, and though they might logically be different things, they all
make the world feel like [A Galaxy Far, Far Away].

Take the details that you grouped into these themes and make a judgment
call. What are the biggest ideas that come from the details you
gathered? What details can you use to communicate the feeling that you
want to lend to your campaign? For each aspect, narrow down the details
to  a list of four to six. The details that you eliminated are handy to
keep in your notes. They are still bundled with the aspects in play and
can be brought out when appropriate.

Some of these details are best presented simply. If you want something
to be definitely true in your game, make it a detail like "Rodians are
bugeyed, twitchy weirdos" or "lightsabers are, in fact, laser
chainsaws." You can convey these details in play.

The other option is to pose a question to the players. The question
hints at the detail, but leaves the expression open to interpretation.
This is best if the detail varies depending on the context, or if you
want to let a player have authority over the detail.

For example, we can take the aspect [A World That Hates and Fears
Them] **** and narrow down the details like so.

Some of these are better off as details given to the players, others as
questions that the players can answer on their own. Some questions might
even be asked several times during a single campaign, each answer adding
something new to the story. Mixing and matching details and questions is
encouraged, since these details will often vary in how specific they'll
need to be and in how much direct control you'll want over them.

## CHARACTER ASPECTS

In addition to mythos setting aspects, you can also create aspects for 
the characters themselves. When you create player character aspects with
mythos details, you're saying very directly, "These are the kinds of
characters that are appropriate for this campaign." It's best to keep
these aspects somewhat broad, though a couple very specific ones could
help push concepts that need more specificity.

The distinction between character and setting aspects is that setting
aspects are generally "zoomed out." A good setting aspect suggests
plenty of details or questions. However, most character aspects are
already small enough to be their own detail. Instead of making a list of
details and questions, let your character aspects be details themselves,
and then attach a question to each. This gives you specificity, but
still gives each player authorship over their character.

### Creating Character Aspects

This process is much the same as creating setting aspects. Look for the
iconic character traits and relationships in whatever genre or setting
you're emulating. Keep them broad and look for patterns. Is the leader
always in red? Is the rebel always a hothead, or does he feel like he
needs to try harder? What difficulties does the brainy inventor have to
overcome? What catches your eye about the character and what do they
struggle with?

Make each of these details into an aspect, and write in a question to go
along with it. Each question should be a counterpoint or embellishment
of its aspect, something that could inspire scenes down the road, but
easy enough for players to answer at the start of play. They can even be
a prompt for a player to describe an NPC's background. Here are a few
examples.

You'll want to point the players toward a functional group dynamic that
echoes your source material, but let the players fill in the blanks with
their own details. Encourage them to use their minor milestones to swap
out aspects, whittling down their character concept from the broad,
archetypal pieces you gave them into a unique individual. During the
first few sessions, it's totally okay for a player to change their high
concept into something more specific once they know their character.

The dial to turn here is how many aspects you want to be filled by
mythos aspects. For a game that starts with characters in fairly rigid
roles, you might have your players choose entirely from lists of mythos
aspects. However, more-flexible party makeups might have just three or
even two of each character's aspects slots filled with mythos aspects.

## ORGANIZING MYTHOS ASPECTS

There are plenty of ways to organize your mythos aspects in a way that
your players can digest. And you'll want to organize them, because there
are few things worse than handing a player a huge stack of cards and
asking them to pick five. Option paralysis sets in quick!

### Label Organization

If you have a large set of setting aspects, it's often best to pick and
choose them beforehand. But if you have two or three, then just present
all of them to the players when you start the game. If you want players
to have a hand in choosing these aspects, or if you have a large list,
then it might help to label the aspects to help tell the players what's
what. Keep these labels broad; you don't want too many. Here are some
examples.

#### THEME

[A World That Hates and Fears Them]

- Senator Kelly is trying to pass the Mutant Registration Act.
- A culture of mutant paranoia
- What terrible things has this mutant endured, for the crime of being
  a mutant?

[Welcome to Mutant High]

- Do the students love or loathe this teacher?
- Cold opening in the Danger Room
- Mutations are diverse, but most are useless or strangely specific

[Globetrotting Mutant Defenders]

- Somewhere new eachepisode
- Mutants endangered, or endangering others

#### ORGANIZATION

[The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]

- Led by Magneto, the Master of Magnetism, Holocaust Survivor
- Mutant supremacists with a mutant populist face
- Gathering forces

[Department K]

- Turning mutants into weapons (Weapon X)
- "We need a favor."

[The X-Men]

- "To me, my X-Men!"
- In Training
- Liaisons to the homo sapiens species

And you might go on to define aspects under **location** and **history**
labels too, but whatever labels makes sense to you will work.

Character aspects are a little more straightforward: Just take your
aspect categories---high concept, trouble, relationship, and backstory
in [[Fate Core]]---and use those as organizational labels. This makes
picking and choosing easy, since you can just slot the aspects in where
the character creation rules tell you.

## Archetype Organization

Another option for character aspects is to define several **archetypes**
for players to fill. When you note down character aspects from your
source material for your players, a rough archetype will take shape for
each character. The gist of this archetype will be the high concept.
Sometimes you want to keep all of the aspects together in a single pool
for players to pick a la carte, which can lead to some interesting
character twists. However, for one-shot games or games with fairly rigid
canons---say, a limited cast of protagonists that gets recycled in each
iteration---more direction might be preferred.

This is just a matter of keeping each source material character's
details separate from the other characters' and combining characters
with similar high concepts. Underneath each character the same
organizational labels above apply. Each player chooses a different high
concept, and their choices of other aspects are narrowed down to only
the aspects under their archetype. Here are some examples.

**High Concept:** [The Rebel]

**Trouble**

- [I need to go blow off some steam?] (Who has a problem with
  your reckless streak?)
- [Berserker Trigger] (What sets you off?)

**Backstory**

- [The Long-lost Sibling] (Who is the most important person
  you met while you were lost?)
- [Animal Testing Escapee] (What triggers your worst memories
  of your time in the lab?)
- [No Patience] (What is your first instinct when you're made
  to wait?)

**Relationship**

- [Bullying [Person] Is My Pass-Time] (Where does your
  bullying stop?)
- [[Person] Needs to Get Off My Case Already] (What does
  this person criticize about you?)
- [[Person] has my back.] (What experience brought you and
  this person closer?)

These lists with preprogrammed choices can almost act like playbooks
from Apocalypse World or other Powered by the Apocalypse games, getting
the players into the game quickly without handing them a fully
pregenerated character.

## Going Forward

Using mythos to define the background of your setting and characters
beforehand can be helpful in one-shot games where time is at a premium.
Long-term games can also benefit from mythos by bringing disparate
expectations together or by giving players clear archetypes to build
characters from so they can get into play quickly. When setting creation
and the phase trio can take a long time, it helps to have something
ready to go and inspire your players when a blank page can be exhausting
just to look at.
