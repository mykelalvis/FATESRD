# Changing Skills: a Matter of Survival

_by Ryan Macklin_

By only having 18 skills, the default skill list in [[Fate Core]] has some
odd quirks and blind spots. Much of that is by design---different
settings should have different skill lists. To quote [[Fate Core]] System,
page 96:

> When you're creating your own setting for use with Fate, you should
> also create your own skill list. The default list we provide is a good
> starting point, but creating skills specific to your world can help
> make it seem richer by reinforcing the story with mechanics.

Of course, we don't tell you in the book how to go about doing that,
partly because there's no one true way and partly because that's not the
job of the core book. In this article, I present a new skill while
walking you through the design process. It sheds some light on how to
make design decisions while building a skill list, and concludes with a
new set of mechanics that were created as a result of rethinking two
skills. Because there's no one true way, the process in the article is
shown by example---one you can use in your own builds, and tweak to
serve your needs.

## Creating the Survival Skill

There's a character archetype that isn't well supported in the default
list: the survivalist. That includes the way Aragorn uses his knowledge
of the wilds in The Fellowship of the Ring, the classic trope of the
street urchin who knows how to survive in the urban jungle, characters
like Robinson Crusoe or Oliver Queen (especially how he's portrayed in
Arrow), and so on.

The ratio of 18 skills/10 skill slots (which I call "the 55%
Rule"---more about that in a moment) is key to Fate's skill economy,
because it means that any given character only gets reasonable spotlight
time with just over half of the skills. To keep the ratio with minimum
fuss, I'm going to swap out another skill---the natural choice for that
is [[Notice]], for reasons we'll get into shortly.

### Playing with the 55% Rule

There are a couple of exceptions to the 55% Rule that you should take
into account when making new skills:

- Skills reserved for a privileged few don't count toward the number
  of skill slots determined by the 55% ratio.

- Skills that are split functions count together.

Talents that are rare in a setting, like psionics or magic, are
typically handled as an extra (chapter 11 of [[Fate Core]] System). Some
extras work best as unique skills rather than getting tacked onto an
existing skill. Because those skills aren't available to everyone, they
don't count in the ratio. Furthermore, people taking such a talent are
intentionally making a choice to be competent in something interesting,
so part of the cost is not being competent in another (often related)
set of actions. For instance, someone might take Psionics as a skill and
forgo [[Shoot]] (because he has a stunt called Mind Bullets) or [[Physique]]
(because he doesn't need to work out to use Telekinesis). So the ratio
is skewed slightly, but the competence element enforced by the number of
skill slots remains.

Likewise, if you split a skill into different areas---such as having
[[Lore]] become [[Academics]] (for broad scholarship), Sciences (for technical
knowledge), and [[Lore]] (for occult, spiritual, and religious matters),
then there's no need to add a skill slot. In settings where such splits
matter (such as the upcoming Fate edition of Achtung! Cthulhu splitting
[[Lore]] as above), players who take one of these split skills generally
have a particular branch in mind, not unlike having a specific take or
vibe in mind when taking [[Lore]] from the Core skill set. So if a player
wants their character to have two or more such skills, that's a fine
choice because, while it decreases the number of slots the character
uses for conflict-oriented skills, it privileges them with discovery and
knowledge---which is something of interest to quite a number of Fate
players.

So, the 55% Rule isn't about strictly adhering to a number. Keep it in
mind when building your setting's skill list, but understanding where
each skill fits into the skill economy is just as important to making a
Fate build work.

## Cannibalizing [[Notice]]

[[Notice]] is probably the second-oddest skill in the bunch. (The oddest
goes to [[Resources]], which is its own article. Or series of articles.) It
covers situational awareness, passive discovery, and reflexes in
physical conflicts (in that it covers turn order). So before we
construct the Survival skill, let's parcel out [[Notice]]'s spheres of
influence.

First of all, passive discovery---where the GM might call for a [[Notice]]
roll to see if the characters process something they've just seen or
heard in an actionable fashion---should be split into all the other
skills. [[Investigate]] is the default, but every skill can be used to
discover something: [[Lore]] to process that some arcane writings are
actually a passcode to magically open a door, [[Shoot]] to get a sense of
what weapon was just shot from a distance ("That's a very distinctive
sound" from Leverage's Eliot), [[Empathy]] to reflexively tell if someone's
lying, etc. This means that anything where the character isn't intently
focusing on something, just the brain automatically processing stimuli
in a useful way, is covered by how well versed the character is in a
field. (This will naturally include ways where Survival conveys such
information, such as spotting a useful item in the muck or seeing a
hidden danger.)

We're going to play more with this idea toward the end of the article.

## Constructing Survival

The other two elements---situational awareness and establishing turn
order---work with the skill we'll naturally call "Survival." But that's
not enough, because it doesn't cover those characters in fiction
mentioned above; it doesn't cover the expertise needed to survive in
those worlds. For that, we're going to borrow some of [[Lore]]'s
functionality, where knowledge is useful for [[overcome]] actions and
creating advantages.

At this point, you might be thinking, "Wait, but [[Lore]] covers those
situations already." That's true, but it doesn't inherently model the
characters above. The street kid has street smarts, not the breadth of
knowledge conveyed by [[Lore]]. Oliver Queen is sharp, but in a way that
means a high Survival rather than a high [[Lore]]. Now, we're not going to
completely steal that from [[Lore]]---the person with Great [[Lore]] will be a
virtual encyclopedia, pointing out different plants and animals in a
forest, but not necessarily be useful in action. Likewise, the person
with Great Survival will be able to tell you what's in a book on life in
the desert, but the rest of the library isn't in her wheelhouse.

Fate already has a precedent for skill function double-up, where
[[Athletics]] and [[Fight]] can be used for melee defense, and [[Physique]] and
[[Athletics]] can both be used to get out of tight situations, so this isn't
new. It simply builds on the high-competence nature of Fate characters.

That's enough to construct a Survival skill, using language from [[Notice]]
and [[Lore]]. But let's play with one more thing...

## Spinning Survival as a Defense Skill

> Survival isn't an attack skill.

Another odd hole is [[Shoot]] defenses. Typically [[Athletics]] is used to dodge
a bullet in more cinematic circumstances, but if Survival is based in
part on being able to stay alive, then we can extend that to being a
defense against ranged attacks by hunkering down or taking cover.
(Depending on the nature of the narrative, it might even make more sense
than [[Athletics]].) So we're going to add this as a base function of
Survival.

A noteworthy design bit: this could just as easily be moved into a
Survival stunt, if as a designer you think that's one piece of
functionality too many. The reason I don't mind it is because Survival
isn't an attack skill, and it doesn't defend against combat that's right
in your face.

## Survival

The Survival skill is all about the ability to endure and physically
thrive in the wilds, whether in jungle, desert, or even the streets and
sewers of a city. It covers situational awareness---your overall
perception and the ability to pick out at a glance useful things or
dangers hidden in the surrounding environment.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: You use Survival to overcome obstacles relating to your
environment, such as finding your way through rugged terrain, gathering
edible food and potable water, and so on. Survival is also used to
overcome obstacles relating to reaction: noticing a danger, hearing a
faint sound of someone following you, spotting the concealed gun in that
guy's waistband, etc. Additionally, Survival can be used to treat a
physical consequence akin to being a field medic, provided you have the
proper supplies and time.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: You use Survival to create aspects based on
direct observation of your surroundings---finding an escape route in a
debris-filled building, noticing someone sticking out in a crowd,
tracking an animal or person, etc. When observing people, Survival can
tell you what's going on with them externally; for internal changes, see
[[Empathy]]. You might also use Survival to declare that your character
spots something you can use to your advantage in a situation, such as a
convenient `Escape Route] when you're trying to get out of a
building, or a `Subtle Weakness] in the enemy's line of
defense. For example, if you're in a barroom brawl you could make a
Survival roll to say that you spot a puddle on the floor right next to
your opponent's feet that could cause him to slip.

Survival also allows you to create aspects based on using or
manipulating your environment, such as making a trap or a foxhole,
scrounging for supplies, building a shelter or tools, and otherwise
altering the environment to suit your needs.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: Survival isn't really used for attacks.

![[def_r.svg|30 ]][[Defend]]: You can use Survival to defend against any uses of [[Stealth]]
to get the drop on you or ambush you, or to discover that you're being
observed. Survival is also used to defend against gunfire and other such
attacks, but only when you are huddled down in a defensible position,
such as a foxhole or bunker. (This is the opposite of using [[Athletics]],
which involves avoiding these situations via movement.)

**Special:** Survival is used to establish turn order in a physical
conflict, replacing [[Notice]].### Spreading the Turn Order Love

Since the skill to survive in the wilds is now how turn order is
determined in a conflict, and not every great fighter is also a master
of the outdoors, you could use the skill replacement method of stunt
creation to cover other character concepts.### Survival Stunts

The Danger Sense and Body Language Reader stunts from [[Fate Core]] work for
Survival. Depending on how you feel about it, the Reactive Shot might as
well. Here are a couple more stunts tailored specifically for Survival.

- **Animal Ken.** Creatures of the wild are second nature to you. Use
  Survival for [[Empathy]] and [[Rapport]] situations with animals.

- **Master of the Wild.** Pick some sort of terrain or broad
  environment. Once per scene, when you [[create advantage]] that
  involves spending a little time scavenging or manipulating the local
  area, you can give that aspect an additional free invoke.

- **Natural Healer.** Your time in the wilds has taught you how to
  patch yourself up when hurt and to recognize what's good to use
  around you for cleaning wounds or as medicine. You can use Survival
  to address consequences that are physical in nature. (Design note:
  I'm on the fence about whether this is a natural part of the skill
  or a stunt, and sometimes I think that maybe just recovering from a
  mild physical consequence is inherent to Survival.)

- **Master of the Ring.** Given even a brief sense that the situation
  could get physical, you can use [[Fight]] in place of Survival for the
  purposes of establishing turn order and for spotting hidden dangers
  that could come into play during a fight.

- **At Home in Academia.** Whether browsing in the library stacks or
  wandering through the campus garden, no one gets a jump on you on
  your home turf. Use [[Lore]] instead of Survival or [[Empathy]] when
  establishing turn order.

### Making Passive Discovery Cool

Now that we have Survival detailed, we're done with hacking the skill
set, right? Well, yes, but we don't have to stop there. I mentioned
above that we're splitting the passive discover of [[Notice]] into all
skills, so let's extend that concept into a new mechanic: **automatic
discovery**.

This concept centers around rewarding characters with high competence in
any field (which is every character in a Fate game) by ensuring they
never miss key information. In automatic discovery, all of your skills
rated at Good and higher have an additional benefit: they always succeed
at [[overcome]] actions or creating advantages that involve passive
discovery---i.e., any time when the GM would normally call for a skill
roll to spot or hear something that is reflexive and takes no time or
effort. No roll is required; the characters are just that good. Now
instead of the person with a high [[Notice]] being the person who discovers
all things, the person with the high [[Athletics]] notices the martial arts
an opponent is using (thus suggesting where they trained), the high
[[Burglary]] sees the telltale scratches around a lock or window pane that
suggests it's been compromised, and so on.

The characters can still make actions involving active discovery, just
as normal. Nothing's changing in that regard for creating advantages or
other actions that involve focused effort. After all, [[Notice]] isn't
really useful in that regard; that's where [[Investigate]] (or other skills,
depending on the situation) comes into play.

Furthermore, we'll add a little bit more to skills that are Great or
higher---assume they succeed with style at passive discovery. That means
extra free invocations or other benefits from being one of the setting's
top experts or masters of that field or discipline.

In settings where gaining knowledge is potentially harmful, such as
those where fighting to retain one's sanity is a big deal, automatically
succeeding at passive discovery is one of the most dangerous things to
have. And that makes it even more interesting. But even without that,
this dynamic highlights every character's mind and ability to discover
and unconsciously process things under fire.

I hope you've enjoyed this walkthrough on making a skill and extending
the rest of the skill list. Happy gaming!
