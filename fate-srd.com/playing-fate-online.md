# Playing Fate Online

## The Most Important Part is Having Fun

There are many ways to play the Fate RPG online and the most important

(owner of the Fate SRD) is collection of his insights from playing Fate
online for the past several years.

Highlights include:

- Use a wiki (or other collaboratively editable tool) for notes.

- Have a single point location that players can use to find
  information.

- Good audio is a must; Video is suggested

- [Trello](https://trello.com/) for managing PCs and Aspects. [Example

- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for video/audio

- [Roll20](https://roll20.net/welcome) for dice, chat, [[Fate Point]]s,
  and the once-in-a-while map.

See how Randy Dean Oest (owner of the Fate SRD) has [started using
FoundryVTT for playing Fate
online](https://randyoest.com/2020/using-foundryvtt-to-run-a-fate-game-secrets-of-cats/index.html).

### Roll20 for non-Tactical Games

There are plenty of articles about using virtual tabletops like Roll20
to do tactical gaming like D&D and its many offspring. This isn't one of
them. We're talking about when you play more narrative games like Blades
in the Dark, Call of Cthulhu, FATE, GUMSHOE, Numenera, and the
like.Â <https://www.dreadunicorngames.com/blog/2020/11/17/roll20-for-non-tactical-games>
