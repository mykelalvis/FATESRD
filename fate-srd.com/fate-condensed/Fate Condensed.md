[[Fate Condensed]] (FCon) is a compact, stand-alone version of the [[Fate Core]] System streamlined for clarity and ease of reference. [[Fate Condensed]] gives you easy-to-digest rules in as few pages as possible, letting you get to the table and roll the dice, fast. It includes a few simple refinements to the [[Fate Core]] engine honed over a decade of active play and development. And best of all, it's 100% compatible with every one of our 90+ Fate products already published.
