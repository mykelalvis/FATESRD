War of Ashes

# Introduction

This Open Content supplement presents rules first seen in _War of Ashes:
Fate of Agaptus_. They cover the following:

- Equipment stunts
- Advanced conflict rules designed to support (but not require) use of
  miniatures
- Magic based on the blessings and curses of capricious gods
- Wondrous artifacts from a lost civilization
- Expanded adventure creation mechanics
- Re-scaling a campaign that has been running for a while

Together they can be used to play a range of fantasy adventures, from
old-school dungeon-delving with Fate rules to epics in the vein of the
Odysseus's adventures.

These rules can be matched either with approaches as in _War of Ashes:
Fate of Agaptus_ or _Fate Accelerated_, or with skills as in [[Fate Core]]
or _Atomic Robo RPG_. Throughout the text, we provide examples based on
both.
